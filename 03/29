We show that if a physical process is weakly dependent on the\nlocal dynamics of the companion and imparts a small relative acceleration to\nthe star-companion system, the eccentricity of the companion's orbit is excited\nto large values depending on the direction and duration of acceleration. A\nnatural candidate for such processes are asymmetric stellar jets and star-disk\nwinds. When the acceleration originates from a precessing jet, large\neccentricities can be excited by the resonance of the jet's precession\nfrequency with the induced acceleration's excitation frequency even for nearly\nperpendicular jets. Precession also reduces the eccentricity amplitude far\ninside the resonance radius. The acceleration's strength is best constrained in\nmultiplanet systems because of the companions' mutual gravitational\nperturbations, while the acceleration's duration is bounded by the condition\nthat the residual velocity imparted to the star is smaller than the stellar\nvelocity dispersion in the Galaxy. In the outer parts of the star-companion\nsystem where the acceleration excitation time is comparable to or smaller than\nthe orbital period, significant radial migration takes place which may have\nimportant consequences for the dynamics of the minor body populations in the\nsolar system.

This, together with strong [Ne III] lines, implies a lower limit for O\nand Ne abundances near solar at the center and also at more than two effective\nradii from the center of NGC 4697. Thus we have found, for the first time from\nindividual stars, direct evidence of the existence of a metal-rich population\nin elliptical galaxies, confirming metallicities derived from absorption-line\nindices and extending the information to angular distances where the stellar\nsurface brightness is too low for absorption-line studies. A comparison with\nabundances obtained closer to the center of NGC 4697 from integrated\nabsorption-line spectra indicates that the metallicity gradient, which is quite\nsteep within one effective radius, becomes much less pronounced beyond one\neffective radius. The only alternative to this interpretation would be the\npresence of a very metal-poor PN population with [Z/H] below -1, which we\ncannot rule out but would require an extremely bimodal metallicity distribution\nwith almost no intermediate metallicities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2005 05:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Small values of I\ncorrespond to the quasi-static regime of soil mechanics, while large values of\nI correspond to the collisional regime of the kinetic theory. Those shear\nstates are homogeneous, and become intermittent in the quasi-static regime.\nWhen I increases in the intermediate regime, we measure an approximately linear\ndecrease of the solid fraction from the maximum packing value, and an\napproximately linear increase of the effective friction coefficient from the\nstatic internal friction value. From those dilatancy and friction laws, we\ndeduce the constitutive law for dense granular flows, with a plastic Coulomb\nterm and a viscous Bagnold term.

The mechanical\ncharacteristics of the grains (restitution, friction and elasticity) have a\nvery small influence in this intermediate regime.

In this formalism, a hierarchy of geometrical\nstructures is constructed on a null hypersurface. On the other side, the 3+1\nformulation of general relativity provides a powerful setting for studying the\nspacetime dynamics, in particular gravitational radiation from black hole\nsystems. Here we revisit the kinematics and dynamics of null hypersurfaces by\nmaking use of some 3+1 slicing of spacetime. In particular, the additional\nstructures induced on null hypersurfaces by the 3+1 slicing permit a natural\nextension to the full spacetime of geometrical quantities defined on the null\nhypersurface. This 4-dimensional point of view facilitates the link between the\nnull and spatial geometries. We proceed by reformulating the isolated horizon\nstructure in this framework. We also reformulate previous works, such as\nDamour's black hole mechanics, and make the link with a previous 3+1 approach\nof black hole horizon, namely the membrane paradigm. We explicit all\ngeometrical objects in terms of 3+1 quantities, putting a special emphasis on\nthe conformal 3+1 formulation. This is in particular relevant for the initial\ndata problem of black hole spacetimes for numerical relativity.

The conjecture then naturally suggests itself\nthat these primitive invariants are congruent to integer-valued degree n-1\ninvariants. In this note, the consequences of this conjecture are explored.\nUnder an additional assumption, it is shown that this conjecture implies that\nthe Conway polynomial of an amphicheiral knot has the property that\nC(z)C(iz)C(z^2) is a perfect square inside the ring of power series with\ninteger coefficients, or, equivalently, the image of C(z)C(iz)C(z^2) is a\nperfect square inside the ring of polynomials with Z_4 coefficients. In fact,\nit is probably the case that the Conway polynomial of an amphicheiral knot\nalways can be written as f(z)f(-z) for some polynomial f(z) with integer\ncoefficients, and this actually implies the above \"perfect squares\" conditions.\nIndeed, by work of Kawauchi and Hartley, this is known for all negative\namphicheiral knots and for all strongly positive amphicheiral knots.

This\ndifficulty is less pronounced if the density estimator is oversmoothed, but the\nproblem of selecting the extent of oversmoothing is inherently difficult. It is\nshown that the optimal bandwidth, in the sense of producing optimally high\nsensitivity, depends on the widths of putative bumps in the unknown density and\nis exactly as difficult to determine as those bumps are to detect.

In contrast to the context just discussed, it\nis shown that the bootstrap distribution of empirical excess mass is a\nrelatively good approximation to its true distribution.

If the translational kinetic\nenergy of a moving breather launched towards the interface is below a critical\nvalue, it is trapped in a region around the interface collecting vibrational\nenergy. For an energy larger than the critical value, the breather is\ntransmitted and continues travelling along the double strand with lower\nvelocity. Reflection phenomena never occur.\n  The same study has been carried out when a single dipole is oriented in\nopposite direction to the other ones.\n  When moving breathers collide with the single inverted dipole, the same\neffects appear. These results emphasize the importance of this simple type of\nlocal inhomogeneity as it creates a mechanism for the trapping of energy.\n  Finally, the simulations show that, under favorable conditions, several\nlaunched moving breathers can be trapped successively at the interface region\nproducing an accumulation of vibrational energy. Moreover, an additional\ncolliding moving breather can produce a saturation of energy and a moving\nbreather with all the accumulated energy is transmitted to the chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2005 12:20:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2005 23:34:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2006 20:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

The Gaussian phase space path integral is formally given by a\ndeterminant built from a first-order differential operator with coherent state\nboundary conditions. We show how this determinant can be expressed in terms of\nthe symplectic transformation generated by the (in general, time-dependent)\nquadratic Hamiltonian for the system. We briefly discuss the conditions under\nwhich the coherent state path integral for a linear system actually exists. A\nnecessary -- but not sufficient -- condition for existence of the path integral\nis that the symplectic transformation generated by the Hamiltonian is\n(unitarily) implementable on the Fock space for the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2005 21:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Finally,\nprobabilities are introduced through Born's formula, which is derived from a\nrecent version of Gleason's theorem.
