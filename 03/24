Here,\nwe compute a new model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way aimed at\nexplaining these new abundance data. The new data can be explained by adopting:\na) the stellar yields obtained from stellar models that take into account\nrotation and b) an extra production of nitrogen in the very metal-poor massive\nstars. In particular, we suggest an increase of nearly a factor of 200 in 14N\nfor a star of 60 Msun and 40 for a star of 9Msun, for metallicities below\nZ=10$^{-5}$, with respect to the yields given in the literature for Z=10$^{-5}$\nand rotational velocity of 300 km/s. We show that once we adopt the above\nprescriptions, our model is able to predict high N/O abundance ratios at low\nmetallicities and still explains the nitrogen abundances observed in thin disk\nstars in the solar vicinity. The physical motivation for a larger nitrogen\nproduction in massive stars in very metal-poor environments could be the fact\nthat some stellar models as well as observational data suggest that at low\nmetallicities stars rotate faster. If this is the case, such large nitrogen\nproduction seen in the pristine phases of the halo formation would not\nnecessarily happen in Damped Lyman-alpha systems which have metallicities\nalways above [Fe/H]$\\simeq -$2.5, and could have been pre-enriched. We also\ncompute the abundance gradient of N/O along the Galactic disk and show that a\nnegative gradient is predicted once we adopt stellar yields where rotation is\ntaken into account. The latter result implies that intermediate mass stars\ncontribute less to the primary nitrogen than previously thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2005 17:44:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2005 14:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We first explore nonlinear simulations that cast the\nlateral diffuse force in the simple, local form of a parallel viscosity.\nSecond, to account for the lateral mixing of radiation associated with the\nradial driving, we next explore models in which the radial force is azimuthally\nsmoothed over a chosen scale.

Our study concerns the temporal evolution of the\nhabitable zone. The distance between the star and the habitable zone, as well\nas its width, increases with time as a consequence of stellar evolution. The\nhabitable zone moves outward after the star leaves the main sequence, sweeping\na wider range of distances from the star until the star reaches the tip of the\nasymptotic giant branch. If life could form and evolve over time intervals from\n$5 \\times 10^8$ to $10^9$ years, then there could be habitable planets with\nlife around red giant stars. For a 1 M$_{\\odot}$ star at the first stages of\nits post main-sequence evolution, the temporal transit of the habitable zone is\nestimated to be of several 10$^9$ years at 2 AU and around 10$^8$ years at 9\nAU. Under these circumstances life could develop at distances in the range 2-9\nAU in the environment of sub-giant or giant stars and in the far distant future\nin the environment of our own Solar System. After a star completes its first\nascent along the Red Giant Branch and the He flash takes place, there is an\nadditional stable period of quiescent He core burning during which there is\nanother opportunity for life to develop.

Arbitrary input distributions and flat fading\nare considered. A generic multiuser detector in the form of the posterior mean\nestimator is applied before single-user decoding. The generic detector can be\nparticularized to the matched filter, decorrelator, linear MMSE detector, the\njointly or the individually optimal detector, and others. It is found that the\ndetection output for each user, although in general asymptotically non-Gaussian\nconditioned on the transmitted symbol, converges as the number of users go to\ninfinity to a deterministic function of a \"hidden\" Gaussian statistic\nindependent of the interferers. Thus the multiuser channel can be decoupled:\nEach user experiences an equivalent single-user Gaussian channel, whose\nsignal-to-noise ratio suffers a degradation due to the multiple-access\ninterference. The uncoded error performance (e.g., symbol-error-rate) and the\nmutual information can then be fully characterized using the degradation\nfactor, also known as the multiuser efficiency, which can be obtained by\nsolving a pair of coupled fixed-point equations identified in this paper. Based\non a general linear vector channel model, the results are also applicable to\nMIMO channels such as in multiantenna systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2005 00:07:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

Despite the generality of the proposed stochastic\nmodels, there are still some unexplained phenomena, which may arise due to the\nlimited size of networks such as protein, e-mail, actor and collaboration\nnetworks. Such networks may in fact exhibit an exponential cutoff in the\npower-law scaling, although this cutoff may only be observable in the tail of\nthe distribution for extremely large networks.

Although Eifler raises genuine issues regarding our model's validity and\napplicability, we are nevertheless of the opinion that it is of value for the\nshort-term evolution of the upper-ocean profiles of current and temperature.\nThe fact that the effective eddy viscosity tends to infinity for infinite time\nunder a steady wind stress may not be surprising. It can be interpreted as a\nvertical shift of the eddy viscosity profile and an increase in the size of the\ndominant turbulent eddies under the assumed conditions of small stratification\nand infinite water depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2005 23:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
