We find that\nthe galaxies with weak or absent Halpha or [OII] emission (known as k+a\ngalaxies) are predominantly bulge-dominated (with a mode of B/T~0.6), while\ngalaxies with nebular emission (known as e[a] galaxies) are mostly\ndisk-dominated (B/T~0.1). The morphologies and (r-k) colours of most k+a\ngalaxies are inconsistent with the hypothesis that they result from the\ntruncation of star formation in normal, spiral galaxies. However, their (u-g)\nand (r-k) colours, as well as their Hdelta line strengths, form a sequence that\nis well matched by a model in which >5 per cent of the stellar mass has been\nproduced in a recent starburst. The lack of scatter in the dust-sensitive (r-k)\ncolours suggests that the unusual spectra of k+a galaxies are not due to the\neffects of dust. The e(a) galaxies, on the other hand, have a colour\ndistribution that is distinct from the k+a population, and typical of normal or\ndusty (tauV~2) spiral galaxies. We conclude that many e(a) galaxies are not\nprogenitors of k+a galaxies, but are a separate phenomenon. Both k+a and e(a)\ngalaxies reside in environments (characterized by the local density of galaxies\nbrighter than Mr=-20) that are typical of normal galaxies and that are\ninconsistent with overdense regions like rich galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2005 23:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Following a description of our\nscientific motivations and target selection criteria, the data reduction\nmethods are described; of critical importance the FLAMES reduction pipeline is\nfound to yield spectra that are in excellent agreement with less automated\nmethods. Spectral classifications and radial velocity measurements are\npresented for each star, with particular attention paid to morphological\npeculiarities and evidence of binarity. These observations represent a\nsignificant increase in the known spectral content of NGC 3293 and NGC 4755,\nand will serve as standards against which our subsequent FLAMES observations in\nthe Magellanic Clouds will be compared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2005 13:15:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2005 13:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

All the films are epitaxial and have cubic unit cell. The\namount of strain relaxation has been varied by taking three different single\ncrystal substrates of SrTiO_3, LaAlO_3 and MgO. It has been found that for\nthicker films the strain gets relaxed and produces variable amount of disorder\ndepending on the strength of strain relaxation. The magnitude of lattice\nrelaxation has been found to be 0.384, 3.057 and 6.411 percent for film\ndeposited on SrTiO_3, LaAlO_3 and MgO respectively.

It is also interesting for the modern theoretical research in the\nquantum information science and raises challenging questions about an\nexperimental assessment of such a programmable models. Together with some\nprogress in the given direction, such ideas encounter specific problems arising\nfrom the very essence of quantum laws. Currently are known two different ways\nto overcome such problems, sometime denoted as a stochastic and deterministic\napproach.

Both programmable quantum networks with\nfinite registers and hybrid models with continuous quantum variables are\nconsidered. As a basic model for the universal programmable quantum network\nwith pure states and finite program register is chosen a \"Control-Shift\"\nquantum processor architecture with three buses introduced in earlier works.
