This process contributes at\nO(alpha_s^2) relative to quark-antiquark annihilation, but its importance is\nenhanced by the large gluon flux at the LHC and by experimental cuts employed\nin Higgs boson searches. We find that gg -> WW provides only a moderate\ncorrection (ca. 5%) to the inclusive W-pair production cross section at the\nLHC. However, after taking into account realistic experimental cuts, the\ngluon-fusion process becomes significant and increases the theoretical WW\nbackground estimate for Higgs searches in the pp -> H -> WW -> leptons channel\nby approximately 30%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2005 16:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Both nonrelativistic and semirelativistic\nHamiltonians are used to obtain the baryon wave functions from a fit to the\nspectra, and the wave functions are expanded in both the harmonic oscillator\nand Sturmian bases. The latter basis leads to form factors in which the\nkinematic dependence on q^2 is in the form of multipoles, and the resulting\nform factors fall faster as a function of q^2 in the available kinematic\nranges. As a result, decay rates obtained in the two models using the Sturmian\nbasis are significantly smaller than those obtained using the harmonic\noscillator basis. In the case of the Lambda_c, decay rates calculated using the\nSturmian basis are closer to the experimentally reported rates. However, we\nfind a semileptonic branching fraction for the Lambda_c to decay to excited\nLambda* states of 11% to 19%, in contradiction with what is assumed in\navailable experimental analyses.

[Physics of Atomic Nuclei 65(3): 400 (2002)]; they were\nmotivated by the experimental observation of small changes in energy of UCN\nupon their collisions with surface. The first hypothesis explaines the nature\nof the observed phenomenon by inelastic coherent scattering of UCN on\nnanoparticles weakly attached at surface, in a state of permanent thermal\nmotion. It got experimental confirmed in ref. [Physics of Atomic Nuclei 65(11):\n1996 (2002)]. The second hypothesis inverts the problem of neutron interaction\nwith nanoparticles in the following sence. In all experiments with UCN, the\ntrap-wall temperature was much higher than a temperature of about 1 mK, which\ncorresponds to the UCN energy. Therefore, UCN preferentially increased their\nenergy. The surface density of weakly attached nanoparticles was low. If,\nhowever, the nanoparticles temperature is lower than the neutron temperature\nand if the nanoparticles density is high, the problem of interaction of\nneutrons with nanoparticles is inverted. In this case, the neutrons can cool\ndown, under certain conditions, owing tot heir scattering on\nultracold-heavy-water, deuterium, and oxigen nanoparticles to their temperature\nof about 1 mK, with result that the UCN density increases by many orders of\nmagnitude.
