Two observations of the pulsar taken 6 days\napart yield an upper limit on its spin-down rate of dP/dt < 7E-14 s/s and no\nevidence for binary orbital motion. The implied energy loss rate is dE/dt <\n2E36 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength is B_p < 3E12 G, and spin-down age\nis t > 24 kyr. The latter exceeds the remnant's estimated age, suggesting that\nthe pulsar was born spinning near its current period. The X-ray spectrum of PSR\nJ1852+0040 is best characterized by a blackbody model of temperature kT_BB =\n0.44 +/- 0.03 keV, radius R_BB approx. 0.9 km, and L_bol = 3.7E33 ergs/s at d =\n7.1 kpc. The sinusoidal light curve is modulated with a pulsed fraction of\n>45%, suggestive of a small hot spot on the surface of the rotating neutron\nstar. The lack of a discernible pulsar wind nebula is consistent with an\ninterpretation of PSR J1852+0040 as a rotation-powered pulsar whose spin-down\nluminosity falls below the empirical threshold for generating bright wind\nnebulae, dE/dt_c approx. 4E36 ergs/s. The age discrepancy implies that its\ndE/dt has always been below dE/dt_c, perhaps a distinguishing property of the\nCCOs. Alternatively, the X-ray spectrum of PSR J1852+0040 suggests a\nlow-luminosity AXP, but the weak inferred B_p field is incompatible with a\nmagnetar theory of its X-ray luminosity. So far, we cannot exclude accretion\nfrom a fall-back disk. The ordinary spin parameters discovered from PSR\nJ1852+0040 highlight the difficulty that existing theories of isolated neutron\nstars have in explaining the high luminosities and temperatures of CCO thermal\nX-ray spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2005 01:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We use coarse-grained Go-like models for\nRNA hairpins to explore forced-unfolding over a broad range of temperatures. A\nnumber of predictions that are amenable to experimental tests are made. At the\ncritical force the hairpin jumps between folded and unfolded conformations\nwithout populating any discernible intermediates. The phase diagram in the\nforce-temperature (f,T) plane shows that the hairpin unfolds by an all-or-none\nprocess. The cooperativity of the unfolding transition increases dramatically\nat low temperatures. Free energy of stability, obtained from time averages of\nmechanical unfolding trajectories, coincide with ensemble averages which\nestablishes ergodicity. The hopping time between the the native basin of\nattraction (NBA) and the unfolded basin increases dramatically along the phase\nboundary. Thermal unfolding is stochastic whereas mechanical unfolding occurs\nin \"quantized steps\" with great variations in the step lengths. Refolding\ntimes, upon force quench, from stretched states to the NBA is \"at least an\norder of magnitude\" greater than folding times by temperature quench. Upon\nforce quench from stretched states the NBA is reached in at least three stages.\nIn the initial stages the mean end-to-end distance decreases nearly\ncontinuously and only in the last stage there is a sudden transition to the\nNBA. Because of the generality of the results we propose that similar behavior\nshould be observed in force quench refolding of proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2005 19:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
