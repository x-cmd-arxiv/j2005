While electrons\nstream along magnetic field lines their energy distribution evolves in time\nessentially because of inverse Compton and synchrotron losses.

Following the classical method of\nAichelburg and Sexl, we determine the gravitational field generated by a black\nring moving ``with the speed of light'' in an arbitrary direction. In\nparticular, we study in detail two different boosts along axes orthogonal and\nparallel to the plane of the ring circle, respectively. In both cases, after\nthe limit one obtains a five-dimensional impulsive pp-wave propagating in\nMinkowski spacetime. The curvature singularity of the original static spacetime\nbecomes a singular source within the wave front, in the shape of a ring or a\nrod according to the direction of the boost. In the case of an orthogonal\nboost, the wave front contains also a remnant of the original disk-shaped\nmembrane as a component of the Ricci tensor (which is everywhere else\nvanishing). We also analyze the asymptotic properties of the boosted black ring\nat large spatial distances from the singularity, and its behaviour near the\nsources. In the limit when the singularity shrinks to a point, one recovers the\nwell known five-dimensional analogue of the Aichelburg-Sexl ``monopole''\nsolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2005 17:13:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2005 18:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We regulate the problem with a momentum\ncutoff and absorb the cutoff dependence using a momentum-independent\ncounterterm potential. The strength of this counterterm is uniquely determined\nand runs on a limit cycle. We also calculate the bound state spectrum and\nscattering observables, emphasizing the manifestation of the limit cycle in\nthese observables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2005 02:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Its properties are studied in\ndetail making use of 'the mixing property of relative entropy' derived in this\narticle. A precise relation between the measure of coherence of an observable\nand that of its coarsening is obtained and discussed from the intutitive point\nof view. Convexity of the measure is proved, and thus the fact that it is an\ninformation entity is established. A few more detailed properties of coherence\ninformation are derived with a view to investigate final-state entanglement in\ngeneral repeatable measurement, and, more importantly, general bipartite\nentanglement in follow ups of this study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2005 09:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The subsystems represent\nparticles of arbitrary spin j which transform according to an irreducible\nrepresentation of the rotation group. A positive map theta is introduced which\ndescribes the time reversal symmetry of the local states and which is unitarily\nequivalent to the transposition of matrices. It is shown that the partial time\nreversal transformation theta_2 = (I tensor theta) acting on the composite\nsystem can be expressed in terms of the invariant 6-j symbols introduced by\nWigner into the quantum theory of angular momentum. This fact enables a\ncomplete geometrical construction of the manifold of states with positive\npartial transposition and of the sets of separable and entangled states of (4\ntensor 4) systems. The separable states are shown to form a three-dimensional\nprism and a three-dimensional manifold of bound entangled states is identified.\nA positive maps is obtained which yields, together with the time reversal, a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the separability of states of (4 tensor\n4) systems. The relations to the reduction criterion and to the recently\nproposed cross norm criterion for separability are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2005 14:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
