In this\nsecond paper, we present a deeper analysis of the morphological properties of\nthese systems, including both the host galaxies and their surrounding aligned\nemission. The host galaxies of our 6C subsample are well described as de\nVaucouleurs ellipticals, with typical scale sizes of ~10kpc.

The contribution of nuclear\npoint source emission is also comparable, regardless of radio power. The 6C\nalignment effect is remarkably similar to that seen around more powerful 3CR\nsources at the same redshift in terms of extent and degree of alignment with\nthe radio source axis, although it is generally less luminous. The bright,\nknotty features observed in the case of the z~1 3CR sources are far less\nfrequent in our 6C subsample; neither do we observe such strong evidence for\nevolution in the strength of the alignment effect with radio source size/age.\nHowever, we do find a very strong link between the most extreme alignment\neffects and emission line region properties indicative of shocks, regardless of\nsource size/age or power. In general, the 6C alignment effect is still\nconsiderably stronger than that seen around lower redshift galaxies of similar\nradio powers.

We have used our spectral\ndata to determine the radial variation in the strength of Hdelta absorption in\nthese galaxies and hence map out the distribution of this recently formed\nstellar population. Such information provides important clues as to what\nphysical event might have been responsible for this quite dramatic change in\nstar formation activity in these galaxies' recent past. We find a diversity of\nbehaviour amongst these galaxies in terms of the radial variation in Hdelta\nabsorption: Four galaxies show little Hdelta absorption across their entire\nextent; it would appear they were misidentified as E+A galaxies in the earlier\nintegrated spectroscopic studies. The remainder show strong Hdelta absorption,\nwith a gradient that is either negative (Hdelta equivalent width decreasing\nwith radius), flat, or positive. By comparing with numerical simulations we\nsuggest that the first of these different types of radial behaviour provides\nevidence for a merger/interaction origin, whereas the latter two types of\nbehaviour are more consistent with the truncation of star formation in normal\ndisk galaxies. It would seem therefore that more than one physical mechanism is\nresponsible for E+A formation in the same environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2005 03:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-10"}

The complex\nenvironment of the remnant renders modeling of its broadband spectrum sensitive\nto assumptions concerning the nature and parameters of the circumremnant\nmedium. This paper explores a sampling of reasonable possibilities for\nmultiwavelength spectral predictions from this source, using a non-linear model\nof diffusive particle acceleration at the shocked shell. The magnetic field\nstrength, shell size and degree of particle cross-field diffusion act as\nvariables to which the radio to X-ray to gamma-ray signal is sensitive. The\nmodeling of the extant data constrains these variables, and the potential\nimpact of the recent HESS detection on such parameters is addressed. Putative\npion decay signals in hard gamma-rays resulting from hadronic interactions in\ndense molecular clouds are briefly discussed; the requisite suppression of the\nGeV component needed to accommodate the 3EG J1714-3857 EGRET data provides\npotential bounds on the diffusive distance from the shell to the proximate\nclouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2005 15:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

James (2005b) recently obtains an\nexact analysis for such models yielding expressions of the likelihood in terms\nof quite tractable Fourier-Cosine integrals. Here, our idea is to analyze a\nclass of likelihoods, which can be used for similar purposes, but where the\nlatent regression models are based on n conditionally independent models with\ndistributions belonging to a subclass of the generalized hyperbolic\ndistributions and whose corresponding parameters are representable as linear\nfunctionals of a common unobserved Poisson random measure.

This analysis of the data used a comparison with a model for the\ntransition to chaos via gluing bifurcations in optically excited nematic liquid\ncrystals previously proposed by G. Demeter and L. Kramer. The model of these\nlast authors, proposed about twenty years before, does not have the central\nsymmetry which one would expect for minimal dimensional models for chaos in\nnematics in view of the time series. What we show here is that the simplest\ntruncated normal forms for gluing, with the appropriate symmetry and minimal\ndimension, do exhibit time signals that are embarrassingly similar to the ones\nfound using the above mentioned experimental settings. The gluing bifurcation\nscenario itself is only visible in limited parameter ranges and substantial\naspect of the chaos that can be observed is due to other factors. First, out of\nthe immediate neighborhood of the homoclinic curve, nonlinearity can produce\nexpansion leading to chaos when combined with the recurrence induced by the\nhomoclinic behavior. Also, pairs of symmetric homoclinic orbits create extreme\nsensitivity to noise, so that when the noiseless approach contains a rich\nbehavior, minute noise can transform the complex damping into sustained chaos.\nLeonid Shil'nikov taught us that combining global considerations and local\nspectral analysis near critical points is crucial to understand the\nphenomenology associated to homoclinic bifurcations.
