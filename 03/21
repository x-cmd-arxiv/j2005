We demonstrate that a non-axisymmetric\nsuperposition of the pulsation and rotation velocity fields results in a\nqualitatively new behaviour of some of the line profile characteristics. It is\nfound that for the majority of roAp stars the second moment varies with the\npulsation frequency rather than with its first harmonic even for axisymmetric\nmodes. We also identify pulsation observables which do not change during\npulsation cycle but are modulated by the stellar rotation and can contribute to\nthe variability of the stellar spectra averaged over many pulsation cycles. As\nan illustration of the new version of the moment technique, we compute\nrotational modulation of the pulsational changes of the line profile moments\nfor the oblique axisymmetric dipolar pulsation modes with different parameters.\nIt is also shown that a distortion of the oblique dipolar modes predicted by\nthe recent theoretical studies of the stellar magneto-acoustic oscillations can\nbe readily diagnosed through the moment analysis. In particular, the shape of\nthe pulsation phase modulation for the radial velocity and the second moment is\nvery sensitive to non-axisymmetric pulsation components, whereas the rotational\nmodulation of the second moment amplitude is best suited to reveal axisymmetric\nmagnetically induced distortion of pulsations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2005 11:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We find that our data\ndeviate significantly from the literature values for polycrystalline materials.\nThe dependence of the heat capacity on the isotopic mass has also been\ninvestigated recently for monatomic crystals such as diamond, silicon, and\ngermanium. Multi-atomic crystals are expected to exhibit a different dependence\nof these heat capacities on the masses of each of the isotopes present. These\neffects have not been investigated in the past. We also present\n\\textit{first-principles} calculations of the dependence of the heat capacities\nof GaN, as a canonical binary material, on each of the Ga and N masses. We show\nthat they are indeed different, as expected from the fact that the Ga mass\naffects mainly the acoustic, that of N the optic phonons. It is hoped that\nthese calculations will encourage experimental measurements of the dependence\nof the heat capacity on isotopic masses in binary and more complex\nsemiconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2005 13:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Zurek, Physica Scripta, T76,\n186 (1998)] that the chaotic tumbling of the satellite Hyperion would become\nnon-classical within 20 years, but for the effects of environmental\ndecoherence. The dynamics of quantum and classical probability distributions\nare compared for a satellite rotating perpendicular to its orbital plane,\ndriven by the gravitational gradient. The model is studied with and without\nenvironmental decoherence. Without decoherence, the maximum quantum-classical\n(QC) differences in its average angular momentum scale as hbar^{2/3} for\nchaotic states, and as hbar^2 for non-chaotic states, leading to negligible QC\ndifferences for a macroscopic object like Hyperion. The quantum probability\ndistributions do not approach their classical limit smoothly, having an\nextremely fine oscillatory structure superimposed on the smooth classical\nbackground. For a macroscopic object, this oscillatory structure is too fine to\nbe resolved by any realistic measurement. Either a small amount of smoothing\n(due to the finite resolution of the apparatus) or a very small amount of\nenvironmental decoherence is sufficient ensure the classical limit. Under\ndecoherence, the QC differences in the probability distributions scale as\n(hbar^2/D)^{1/6}, where D is the momentum diffusion parameter. We conclude that\ndecoherence is not essential to explain the classical behavior of macroscopic\nbodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2005 01:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
