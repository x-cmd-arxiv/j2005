The method entails choosing\na large of pairs of foreground lens galaxies and constructing a mean shear map\nwith respect to their axis, by averaging the ellipticities of background source\ngalaxies. An average mass map can be reconstructed from this shear map and this\nwill represent the average mass distribution around pairs of galaxies. We show\nhow this mass map is related to the projected galaxy-galaxy-mass three-point\ncorrelation function. Using a large N-body dark matter simulation populated\nwith galaxies using the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) bias prescription,\nwe compute these correlation functions, mass maps, and shear maps. The\nresultant mass maps are distinctly bimodal, tracing the galaxy centers and\nremaining anisotropic up to scales much larger than the galaxy separation. At\nlarger scales, the shear is approximately tangential about the center of the\npair but with small azimuthal variation in amplitude. We estimate the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed mass maps for a survey of similar\ndepth to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and conclude that the\ngalaxy-galaxy-mass three-point function should be measurable with the current\nSDSS weak lensing data. Measurements of this three-point function, along with\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy auto-correlation functions, will provide new\nconstraints on galaxy bias models. The anisotropic shear profile around close\npairs of galaxies is a prediction of cold dark matter models and may be\ndifficult to reconcile with alternative theories of gravity without dark\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2005 05:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The high specific frequency is confirmed, yet\nthe exact value remains uncertain because of the uncertain distance: it varies\nbetween 5.6+-1.2 and 8.9+-1.2. The globular cluster system has a clearly\nbimodal color distribution. The color peak positions show no radial dependence\nand are in good agreement with the values found for other galaxies studied in\nthe same filter system. However, a luminosity dependence is found: brighter\nclusters with an ``intermediate'' color exist.

Because of the difference in the cluster and\nlight distribution the specific frequency increases considerably with radius.\nAt 7' and 9' the density profiles of the red and blue clusters, respectively,\nchange strongly which indicates that we reach the outer rim of the cluster\nsystem at approximately 11'.
