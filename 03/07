In this approach, the WMAP statement excluding\nthe pure phi^4 potential implies the presence of an inflaton mass term at the\nscale m ~ 10^{13}GeV.Chaotic, new and hybrid inflation models are studied in an\nunified manner.In all cases the inflaton potential takes the form V(phi)=m^2\nM_{Pl}^2 v(phi/M_{Pl}), where all coefficients in v(varphi) are of order one.If\nsuch potential corresponds to supersymmetry breaking, the susy scale is sqrt{m\nM_{Pl}}~10^{16}GeV which coincides with the GUT scale. For red tilted spectrum\nnew inflation turns to be favoured while for blue tilted spectrum, hybrid\ninflation turns to be the best choice.In both cases, we find an analytic\nformula relating the inflaton mass with r (tensor/scalar ratio) and the scalar\nspectral index ns: 10^6 m/M_{Pl} = 127 sqrt{r|1-n_s|} where the numerical\ncoefficient follows from the WMAP amplitude. We review quantum phenomena during\ninflation which contribute to relevant observables in the CMB anisotropies and\npolarization and we focus on inflaton decay.The deviation from the scale\ninvariant power spectrum is measured by a small parameter Delta.Delta regulates\nthe infrared divergences too.In slow roll inflation, Delta is a simple function\nof the slow roll parameters.

A Neyman-Pearson test is used to define the region of\nacceptance, that is given by a sufficient linear detector that is independent\non the amplitude distribution of the sources. We study how detection can be\nenhanced by means of linear filters with a scaling parameter and compare some\nof them (the Mexican Hat wavelet, the matched and the scale-adaptive filters).\nWe introduce a new filter, that depends on two free parameters (biparametric\nscale-adaptive filter). The value of these two parameters can be determined,\ngiven the a priori pdf of the amplitudes of the sources, such that the filter\noptimizes the performance of the detector in the sense that it gives the\nmaximum number of real detections once fixed the number density of spurious\nsources. The combination of a detection scheme that includes information on the\ncurvature and a flexible filter that incorporates two free parameters (one of\nthem a scaling) improves significantly the number of detections in some\ninteresting cases. In particular, for the case of weak sources embedded in\nwhite noise the improvement with respect to the standard matched filter is of\nthe order of 40%.

The necessary and sufficient condition for a Liouville type\ntheorem to hold is that the real Fermi surface of the elliptic operator\nconsists of finitely many points (modulo the reciprocal lattice). Thus, such a\ntheorem generically is expected to hold at the edges of the spectrum.
