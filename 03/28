We discuss the case of three different objects (triangle, 2-screen,\nlouver-like 6-screen) and show that they have a transit lightcurve\ndistinguishable from the transit of natural planets, either spherical or\noblate, although an ambiguity with the transit of a ringed planet exists in\nsome cases.

We show\nthat no acceleration can be produced by this mechanism. We begin by showing how\nthe application of Raychaudhuri equation to inhomogeneous cosmologies results\nin several ``no go'' theorems for accelerated expansion. Next we derive an\nexact solution for a specific case of initial perturbations, for which\napplication of the Kolb et al. expressions leads to an acceleration, while the\nexact solution reveals that no acceleration is present. We show that the\ndiscrepancy can be traced to higher order terms that were dropped in the Kolb\net al. analysis. We proceed with the analysis of initial value formulation of\ngeneral relativity to argue that causality severely limits what observable\neffects can be derived from superhorizon perturbations. By constructing a\nRiemann normal coordinate system on initial slice we show that no infrared\ndivergence terms arise in this coordinate system. Thus any divergences found\npreviously can be eliminated by a local rescaling of coordinates and are\nunobservable. We perform an explicit analysis of the variance of the\ndeceleration parameter for the case of single field inflation using usual\ncoordinates and show that the infrared divergent terms found by Barausse et al.\nand Kolb et al. cancel against several additional terms not considered in their\nanalysis. Finally, we argue that introducing isocurvature perturbations does\nnot alter our conclusion that the accelerating expansion of the universe cannot\nbe explained by superhorizon modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2005 21:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Restricting our consideration to the genoise,\none of the basic cakes of classic French cuisine, we have obtained a\nsemi-empirical formula for its baking time as a function of oven temperature,\ninitial temperature of the cake batter, and dimensions of the unbaked cake. The\nformula, which is based on the Diffusion equation, has three adjustable\nparameters whose values are estimated from data obtained by baking genoises in\ncylindrical pans of various diameters. The resulting formula for the baking\ntime exhibits the scaling behavior typical of diffusion processes, i.e. the\nbaking time is proportional to the (characteristic length scale)^2 of the cake.\nIt also takes account of evaporation of moisture at the top surface of the\ncake, which appears to be a dominant factor affecting the baking time of a\ncake. In solving this problem we have obtained solutions of the Diffusion\nequation which are interpreted naturally and straightforwardly in the context\nof heat transfer; however, when interpreted in the context of the Schrodinger\nequation, they are somewhat peculiar. The solutions describe a system whose\nmass assumes different values in two different regions of space. Furthermore,\nthe solutions exhibit characteristics similar to the evanescent modes\nassociated with light waves propagating in a wave guide. When we consider the\nSchrodinger equation as a non-relativistic limit of the Klein-Gordon equation\nso that it includes a mass term, these are no longer solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2005 10:56:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2005 16:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
