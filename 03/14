It was followed\nby a very bright, fading radio afterglow. Extensive follow-up radio\nobservations provided a wealth of information with unprecedented astrometric\nprecision, revealing the temporal evolution of the source size, along with\ndensely sampled light curves and spectra. Here we expand on our previous work\non this source, by explaining these observations within one self-consistent\ndynamical model. In this scenario, the early radio emission is due to the\noutflow ejected during the GF energizing a thin shell surrounding a\npre-existing cavity, where the observed steep temporal decay of the radio\nemission seen beginning on day 9 is attributed to the adiabatic cooling of the\nshocked shell. The shocked ejecta and external shell move outward together,\ndriving a forward shock into the ambient medium, and are eventually decelerated\nby a reverse shock. As we show in Gelfand et al. (2005), the radio emission\nfrom the shocked external medium naturally peaks when significant deceleration\noccurs, and then decays relatively slowly. The dynamical modeling of the\ncollision between the ejecta and the external shell together with the observed\nevolution of the source size (which is nicely reproduced in our model) suggest\nthat most of the energy in the outflow was in mildly relativistic material,\nwith an initial expansion velocity $v/c \\lesssim 0.7d_{15}$, for a distance of\n$15d_{15}$ kpc to SGR 1806-20.

During accretion, the magnetic\nfield of a neutron star is compressed into a narrow belt at the magnetic\nequator by material spreading equatorward from the polar cap. In turn, the\ncompressed field confines the accreted material in a polar mountain which is\nmisaligned with the rotation axis in general, producing gravitational waves.\nThe equilibrium hydromagnetic structure of the polar mountain, and its\nassociated mass quadrupole moment, are computed as functions of the accreted\nmass, M_a, by solving a Grad-Shafranov boundary value problem. The orientation-\nand polarization-averaged gravitational wave strain, h_c ~ 6e-24 for a 0.6 kHz\nsource at 1 kpc with M_a > 10^-5 M_Sun, exceeds previous estimates that failed\nto treat equatorward spreading and flux freezing self-consistently.

Now we observe unreasonable rejection of the\nnon-Riemannian geometry by the official representatives of the contemporary\ngeometry. Class of the Riemannian geometries appears to be too narrow for\nphysical applications. The microcosm physics needs expansion of the class of\npossible geometries appropriate for the role of space-time geometry. In the\nframework of the non-Riemannian geometry one can construct the space-time\ngeometry, where the motion of free particles is primordially stochastic, and\nthis stochasticity depends on the particle mass. At the same time the geometry\nin itself is not stochastic in the sense that the space-time intervals are\ndeterministic. Principles of quantum mechanics can be deduced from such a\nspace-time geometry. The crisis situation in geometry appears to be connected\nwith some preconceptions concerning the foundation of the geometry. The\npreconceptions as well as the crisis generated by them are not purely\nscientific phenomena. The human factor (social aspect) is rather strong in the\ncrisis phenomena. The preconceptions and the human factor appear to be so\nstrong, that usual logical arguments are not perceived, and the usual formal\nmathematical language appears to be inappropriate for perception of an analysis\nof the crisis origin and of a possibility of its overcoming. In the paper the\nhistory and motives of the non-Riemannian geometry construction are presented.\nThere is a hope that such a less formal way of presentation helps to understand\nand to overcome the existing preconceptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2005 13:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The chemical\ncycles of both heads are coordinated exclusively by the mechanical connection\nbetween the two lever arms.

The main difference\nbetween the two models concerns the load dependence of the run length, which is\nmuch weaker in the 5-state model.
