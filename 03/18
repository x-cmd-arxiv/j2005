Attention is paid on the relation between the\napparent and parent non-rotating counterpart stellar fundamental parameters and\napparent and true vsini parameters as a function of the rotation rate\nOmega/Omega_c, stellar mass and inclination angle. It is shown that omission of\ngravitational darkening in the analysis of chemical abundances of CNO elements\ncan produce systematic overestimation or underestimation, depending on the\nlines used, rotational rate and inclination angle. The proximity of Be stars to\nthe critical rotation is re-discussed by correcting not only the vsini of 130\nBe stars, but also their effective temperature and gravity to account for\nstellar rotationally induced geometrical distortion and for the concomitant\ngravitational darkening effect. We concluded that the increase of the vsini\nestimate is accompanied by an even higher value of the stellar equatorial\ncritical velocity, so that the most probable average rate of angular velocity\nof Be stars attains Omega/Omega_c ~ 0.88.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2005 17:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Bright,\nusually complex bursts have many narrow pulses that are difficult to model due\nto overlap. However, the relatively simple, long spectral lag, wide-pulse\nbursts may have simpler physics and are easier to model. In this work we\nanalyze the temporal and spectral behavior of wide pulses in 24 long-lag\nbursts, using a pulse model with two shape parameters -- width and asymmetry --\nand the Band spectral model with three shape parameters. We find that pulses in\nlong-lag bursts are distinguished both temporally and spectrally from those in\nbright bursts: the pulses in long spectral lag bursts are few in number, and ~\n100 times wider (10s of seconds), have systematically lower peaks in nu*F(nu),\nharder low-energy spectra and softer high-energy spectra. We find that these\nfive pulse descriptors are essentially uncorrelated for our long-lag sample,\nsuggesting that at least five parameters are needed to model burst temporal and\nspectral behavior. However, pulse width is strongly correlated with spectral\nlag; hence these two parameters may be viewed as mutual surrogates. We infer\nthat accurate formulations for estimating GRB luminosity and total energy will\ndepend on several gamma-ray attributes, at least for long-lag bursts. The\nprevalence of long-lag bursts near the BATSE trigger threshold, their\npredominantly low nF(n) spectral peaks, and relatively steep upper power-law\nspectral indices indicate that Swift will detect many such bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2005 20:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We extend the\nvariational method to a poor solvent regime where the balance between the\ntwo-body attractive and the three-body repulsive interactions leads to\ncontraction of the chain to form a globule. By employing the Ginzburg\ncriterion, we recover the correct scaling for the $\\theta$-temperature.

There are overstressed and understressed\nvertical cylindrical zones with \"bubble-shaped\" cross-sections, in which\nacoustic body waves are supposed to reflect. The horizontal size and the shape\nof the stress modified areas depend on the values of (K1+K2)/2 - with K1=SH/Sv\n(the overburden pressure) and K2=Sh/Sv -, that is to say on the in situ\nhorizontal stress and the anisotropy of this stress. The calculation of the\nvelocities of the P and S double waves allows us to evaluate the radial\nthicknesses of these stress modified areas. As their values are different\naccording to whether they result from P or S waves, we propose an explanation\nbased on their wavelengths.

There, in spite of\nthe presence of dissipation (in a form of kinematic viscosity), energy is still\nconserved.
