Combined with short\ntimescale XMM-Newton observations, we derive the powerspectral density (PSD)\ncovering 6 decades from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-2} Hz. As with NGC4051, another NLS1,\nthe PSD of MCG-6-30-15 is a close analogue of the PSD of a Galactic Black Hole\nX-ray binary system (GBH) in a `high' rather than a `low' state. Like high\nstate GBHs, its PSD is better fitted by a smoothly bending rather than sharply\nbreaking powerlaw model and the break frequency is 7.6^{+10}_{-3} x 10^{-5} Hz.\nAssuming linear scaling of break frequency with mass, we estimate the black\nhole (BH) mass in MCG-6-30-15 to be ~2.9^{+1.8}_{-1.6} X 10^{6} solar masses.\nWe also derive the BH mass using a variety of new optical observations and find\na value between 3.6 and 6 x 10^{6} solar masses, consistent with the mass\nderived from the PSD. Combining these data with revised reverberation masses\nfor other AGN we update the BH mass/break timescale diagram. The observations\nare consistent with NLS1s having shorter break timescales, for a given mass,\nthan broad line AGN, probably reflecting a higher accretion rate. However the\ndata are also consistent with all of the X-ray bright AGN being high state\nobjects. This result may simply be a selection effect, based on their selection\nfrom X-ray all sky catalogues, and their consequent typically high X-ray/radio\nratios, which indicate high state systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2005 16:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Low-resolution spectra of these objects\nhave been extracted from the HST+ACS grism data taken over the UDF by the\nGRAPES project. Redshift for the 7 galaxies have been identified based on the\nUV feature at rest frame 2640<lambda<2850 AA. This feature is mainly due to a\ncombination of FeII, MgI and MgII absorptions which are characteristic of\nstellar populations dominated by stars older than about 0.5 Gyr. The redshift\nidentification and the passively evolving nature of these galaxies is further\nsupported by the photometric redshifts and by the overall spectral energy\ndistribution (SED), with the ultradeep HST+ACS/NICMOS imaging revealing compact\nmorphologies typical of elliptical/early-type galaxies. From the SED we derive\nstellar masses of 10^{11}Msun or larger and ages of about 1 Gyr.

Our primary data set for this search were the two J+H NICMOS\nparallel fields taken with the ACS HUDF. The 5 sigma limiting mags were 28.6 in\nJ and 28.5 in H. Several shallower fields were also used: J+H NICMOS frames\navailable over the HDF North, the HDF South NICMOS parallel, and the ACS HUDF.\nThe primary selection criterion was (J-H)>1.8. 11 such sources were found in\nall search fields using this criterion. 8 of these were clearly ruled out as\ncredible z~10 sources, either as a result of detections (>2 sigma) blueward of\nJ or their colors redward of the break (H-K~1.5). The nature of the 3 remaining\nsources could not be determined from the data. The number appears consistent\nwith the expected contamination from low-z interlopers. Analysis of the stacked\nimages for the 3 candidates also suggests contamination. Regardless of their\ntrue redshifts, the actual number of z~10 sources must be <=3. To assess the\nsignificance of these results, two lower redshift samples (a z~3.8 B-dropout\nand z~6 i-dropout sample) were projected to z~8-12 using a (1+z)^{-1} size\nscaling. They were added to the image frames, and the selection repeated,\ngiving 15.6 and 4.8 J-dropouts, respectively. This suggests that to the limit\nof this probe (0.3 L*) there has been evolution from z~3.8 and possibly from\nz~6. This is consistent with the strong evolution already noted at z~6 and\nz~7.5 relative to z~3-4. Even assuming that 3 sources from this probe are at\nz~10, the rest-frame continuum UV (~1500 A) luminosity density at z~10\n(integrated down to 0.3 L*) is just 0.19_{-0.09}^{+0.13}x that at z~3.8 (or\n0.19_{-0.10}^{+0.15}x including cosmic variance). However, if none of our\nsources is at z~10, this ratio has a 1 sigma upper limit of 0.07.

We introduce in the present paper a theoretical method which\nis not restricted by this approximation. It allows us in particular to treat\nconfigurations closer to the actual experimental ones, where the crystal length\nis comparable to the Rayleigh length of the cavity mode. We use this method in\nthe case of the confocal OPO, where the thin crystal approximation predicts\nperfect squeezing on any area of the transverse plane, whatever its size and\nshape. We find that there exists in this case a \"coherence length\" which gives\nthe minimum size of a detector on which perfect squeezing can be observed, and\nwhich gives therefore a limit to the improvement of optical resolution that can\nbe obtained using such devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2005 16:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}
