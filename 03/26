On the other hand, the most recent estimates of\nthe solar carbon and oxygen abundances are also close to those of B stars. If\nthe interstellar abundances are indeed ``subsolar'' like B stars or the\nnewly-determined solar C,O values, there might be a lack of raw material to\nform the dust to account for the interstellar extinction. In literature it has\nbeen argued that this problem could be solved if interstellar grains have a\nfluffy, porous structure since fluffy grains are more effective in absorbing\nand scattering optical and ultraviolet starlight than compact grains (on a per\nunit mass basis). However, we show in this work that, using the Kramers-Kronig\nrelation, fluffy dust is not able to overcome the abundance shortage problem. A\nlikely solution is that the abundances of refractory elements in stellar\nphotospheres may under-represent the composition of the interstellar material\nfrom which stars are formed, resulting either from the possible underestimation\nof the degree of heavy-element settling in stellar atmospheres, or from the\nincomplete incorporation of heavy elements in stars during the star formation\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2005 20:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In this paper, we report the detailed analysis of X-ray\nand infrared observations of the transient and its surroundings. Chandra\nbservations detect the source at a flux of F_X = 2e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (2-8\nkeV). After accounting for absorption both in the interstellar medium and in\nmaterial local to the source, the implied luminosity of the source is only L_X\n= 4e34 erg/s (2-8 keV; D=8 kpc). However, the diffuse X-ray emission near the\nsource also brightened by a factor of 2. The enhanced diffuse X-ray emission\nlies on top of a known ridge of dust and ionized gas that is visible infrared\nimages. We interpret the X-ray emission as scattered flux from the outburst,\nand determine that the peak luminosity of CXOGC J174540.0-290031 was >2e36\nerg/s. We suggest that the relatively small observed flux results from the fact\nthat the system is observed nearly edge-on, so that the accretion disk\nintercepts most of the flux emitted along our line of sight. We compare the\ninferred peak X-ray luminosity to that of the radio jet. The ratio of the X-ray\nto radio luminosities, L_X/L_R<1e4, is considerably smaller than in other known\nLMXBs (> 1e5). This is probably because the jets are radiating with unusually\nhigh efficiency at the point where they impact the surrounding interstellar\nmedium. This hypothesis is supported by a comparison with mid-infrared images\nof the surrounding dust. Finally, we find that the minimum power required to\nproduce the jet, L_jet~1e37 erg/s, is comparable to the inferred peak X-ray\nluminosity. This is the most direct evidence yet obtained that LMXBs accreting\nat low rates release about half of their energy as jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2005 00:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-18"}

Using the H-theorem, within the framework of the two-parameter\nLorentz-like gauge (so called v-gauge), we show that two kinds of magnetic\nvector potentials exist: one of them (solenoidal) can act exclusively with the\nvelocity of light c and the other one (irrotational) with an arbitrary finite\nvelocity $v$ (including a velocity more than c . We show also that the\nirrotational component of the electric field has a physical meaning and can\npropagate exclusively instantaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2005 05:35:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2005 01:23:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 May 2005 18:38:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2005 00:17:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2005 01:32:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
