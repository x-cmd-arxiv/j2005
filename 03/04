In the\nsoft state these index-QPO frequency correlations show a saturation of the\nphoton index about 2.7 at high values of the low frequency.

We reveal the\nspectral evolution of the Comptonized blackbody spectra when the source\ntransitions from the hard to soft states. The hard state spectrum is a typical\nthermal Comptonization spectrum of the soft photons which originate in the disk\nand the NS outer photospheric layers. The hard state photon index is about 2.\nThe soft state spectrum consists of two blackbody components which are only\nslightly Comptonized. Thus we can claim (as expected from theory) that in NS\nsources thermal equilibrium is established for the soft state. To the contrary\nin BH sources, the equilibrium is never established due to the presence of the\nBH horizon. The emergent BH spectrum, even in the high/soft state, has a power\nlaw component.

These trees only sample a fraction of\nthe network's edges, and a recent paper by Lakhina et al. found empirically\nthat the resuting sample is intrinsically biased. For instance, the observed\ndegree distribution under traceroute sampling exhibits a power law even when\nthe underlying degree distribution is Poisson.\n  In this paper, we study the bias of traceroute sampling systematically, and,\nfor a very general class of underlying degree distributions, calculate the\nlikely observed distributions explicitly. To do this, we use a continuous-time\nrealization of the process of exposing the BFS tree of a random graph with a\ngiven degree distribution, calculate the expected degree distribution of the\ntree, and show that it is sharply concentrated. As example applications of our\nmachinery, we show how traceroute sampling finds power-law degree distributions\nin both delta-regular and Poisson-distributed random graphs. Thus, our work\nputs the observations of Lakhina et al. on a rigorous footing, and extends them\nto nearly arbitrary degree distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2005 02:36:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2005 19:29:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2006 06:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We define\nspatio-temporal queries to be computable mappings that are also generic,\nmeaning that the result of a query may only depend to a limited extent on the\nactual internal representation of the spatio-temporal data. Genericity is\ndefined as invariance under groups of geometric transformations that preserve\ncertain characteristics of spatio-temporal data (e.g., collinearity, distance,\nvelocity, acceleration, ...). These groups depend on the notions that are\nrelevant in particular spatio-temporal database applications.\n  These transformations also have the distinctive property that they respect\nthe monotone and unidirectional nature of time.\n  We investigate different genericity classes with respect to the constraint\ndatabase model for spatio-temporal databases and we identify sound and complete\nlanguages for the first-order and the computable queries in these genericity\nclasses. We distinguish between genericity determined by time-invariant\ntransformations, genericity notions concerning physical quantities and\ngenericity determined by time-dependent transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2005 15:34:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2005 17:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}
