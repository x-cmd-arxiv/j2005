At 30 C, the intensity of\ncollapse was increased by slower drying. It was considered that: 1) slower\ndrying resulted in higher sample temperature in the early stage of drying to\nincrease the collapse; 2) rapid drying stiffened the surface of sample and such\n\"shell\" prohibited the following collapse; 3) slower drying i.e. longer loading\nof liquid tension caused more remarkable and/or frequent viscoelastic yields of\ncells. Consequently the intensity of collapse increased when the cane was dried\nfrom its waxy outer surface or in the presence of node: both of them retarded\nthe drying. On the other hand, higher drying temperature caused greater\nintensity of collapse in spite of faster drying. It was suggested that the\nthermal softening of cane cells leads to easier yield of the cell wall, at the\nsame time the rapid drying does not allow the recovery of collapse after the\ndisappearance of free water. These results indicated that faster drying at\nlower temperature is preferable for drying cane with less collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2005 15:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-19"}

Several recent papers refer to this parameter as the \\emph{stopping\ndistance} $s$ of $C$. This is somewhat of a misnomer since the size of the\nsmallest stopping set in the Tanner graph for $C$ depends on the corresponding\nchoice of a parity-check matrix. It is easy to see that $s \\le d$, where $d$ is\nthe minimum Hamming distance of $C$, and we show that it is always possible to\nchoose a parity-check matrix for $C$ (with sufficiently many dependent rows)\nsuch that $s = d$. We thus introduce a new parameter, termed the \\emph{stopping\nredundancy} of $C$, defined as the minimum number of rows in a parity-check\nmatrix $H$ for $C$ such that the corresponding stopping distance $s(H)$ attains\nits largest possible value, namely $s(H) = d$.\n  We then derive general bounds on the stopping redundancy of linear codes. We\nalso examine several simple ways of constructing codes from other codes, and\nstudy the effect of these constructions on the stopping redundancy.\nSpecifically, for the family of binary Reed-Muller codes (of all orders), we\nprove that their stopping redundancy is at most a constant times their\nconventional redundancy. We show that the stopping redundancies of the binary\nand ternary extended Golay codes are at most 35 and 22, respectively. Finally,\nwe provide upper and lower bounds on the stopping redundancy of MDS codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2005 04:56:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2005 12:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-16"}

We start by investigating an ideal case where only the\nelectronic spin interacts successively through the same unitary operation with\nthe spins of the two impurities. In this case, high (but not maximal)\nentanglement can be generated with a significant success probability. We then\nconsider a more realistic description which includes both the forward and back\nscattering amplitudes. In this scenario, we obtain the entanglement between the\nimpurities as a function of the interaction strength of the electron-impurity\ncoupling. We find that our scheme allows us to entangle the impurities\nmaximally with a significant probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2005 01:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
