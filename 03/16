By comparison of\nLYa fluxes with Ha fluxes of a previous study, we estimate that each observed\nLYa photon has undergone ~2 additional scatterings.

The\nexperimental results were compared with the band-structure calculation based on\nLDA + $U$. The band structure of LSMO thin films consists of several highly\ndispersive O 2$p$ derived bands in the binding energy range of 2.0 - 6.0 eV and\nMn 3$d$ derived bands near $E_{F}$. ARPES spectra around the $Gamma$ point show\na dispersive band near $E_{F}$ indicative of an electron pocket centered at the\n$Gamma$ point, although it was not so clearly resolved as an electronlike\npocket due to the suppression of spectral weight in the vicinity of $E_{F}$.\nCompared with the band-structure calculation, the observed conduction band is\nassigned to the Mn 3$de_{g}$ majority-spin band responsible for the\nhalf-metallic nature of LSMO. We have found that the estimated size of the\nFermi surface is consistent with the prediction of the band-structure\ncalculation, while the band width becomes significantly narrower than the\ncalculation. Also, the intensity near $E_{F}$ is strongly reduced. The origin\nof these discrepancies between the experiment and the calculation is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2005 17:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

By considering\nthe interaction of nearest adjacent atoms in dense fluid, the equation of state\npredicts that the isotherm is linear function of, where is the compression\nfactor, is the molar volume, and is the molar density. The linear parameters\nare identified as interaction coefficients related to attraction and repulsion,\nand are used to evaluate the molecular parameters with interesting\nimplications. The isotherm is intended to resolve the particular thermodynamic\nproperties of alkali metals, which have been known for their unusual change of\nthe nature of intermolecular force as the characteristic metal-nonmetal\ntransition range is approached. When applied to liquid cesium, the isotherms\npersist linear over the whole liquid range including the metal non-metals\ntransition range and at the critical temperature perfectly. The isotherm is\nequivalent to a virial (like) EOS for which the linear parameters of the\nisotherm form the corresponding second and third virial coefficients. The new\npotential function turns out to be an effective potential that includes not\nonly a pair interaction but also many-body interactions and therefore it is not\nalways comparable with pair potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2005 14:19:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, this bound only\napplies to codes which recover the message exactly. Naively, one might expect\nthat correcting errors to very high fidelity would only allow small violations\nof this bound. This intuition is incorrect: in this paper we describe quantum\nerror-correcting codes capable of correcting up to (n-1)/2 arbitrary errors\nwith fidelity exponentially close to 1, at the price of increasing the size of\nthe registers (i.e., the coding alphabet). This demonstrates a sharp\ndistinction between exact and approximate quantum error correction. The codes\nhave the property that any $t$ components reveal no information about the\nmessage, and so they can also be viewed as error-tolerant secret sharing\nschemes.\n  The construction has several interesting implications for cryptography and\nquantum information theory. First, it suggests that secret sharing is a better\nclassical analogue to quantum error correction than is classical error\ncorrection. Second, it highlights an error in a purported proof that verifiable\nquantum secret sharing (VQSS) is impossible when the number of cheaters t is\nn/4. More generally, the construction illustrates a difference between exact\nand approximate requirements in quantum cryptography and (yet again) the\ndelicacy of security proofs and impossibility results in the quantum model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2005 17:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
