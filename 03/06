Moreover, any\ndeterminantal process can be represented as a mixture of determinantal\nprojection processes. We give a simple explanation for these known facts, and\nestablish analogous representations for permanental processes, with geometric\nvariables replacing the Bernoulli variables. These representations lead to\nsimple proofs of existence criteria and central limit theorems, and unify known\nresults on the distribution of absolute values in certain processes with\nradially symmetric distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Mar 2005 07:08:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2006 07:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

In this\npaper we present a Swarm Search Algorithm with varying population of agents.\nThe swarm is based on a previous model with fixed population which proved its\neffectiveness on several computation problems. We will show that the variation\nof the population size provides the swarm with mechanisms that improves its\nself-adaptability and causes the emergence of a more robust self-organized\nbehavior, resulting in a higher efficiency on searching peaks and valleys over\ndynamic search landscapes represented here - for the purpose of different\nexperiments - by several three-dimensional mathematical functions that suddenly\nchange over time. We will also show that the present swarm, for each function,\nself-adapts towards an optimal population size, thus self-regulating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2005 20:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
