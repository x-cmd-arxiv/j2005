These power spectra reveal\nstructure over a wide range of scales. For 6 of the galaxies the power spectrum\nslopes at intermediate scales (1-400 pc) in the V-band images range from -1.3\nto -1.5. The similarity of slopes suggests that the same processes are\nstructuring these systems. These slopes are slightly shallower than what is\nobserved in other galaxies in HI, molecular emission, dust extinction, and\noptical light. Three of the galaxies have flat power spectra like noise from\nthe sky; these three galaxies are relatively indistinct in the direct images.\nThe power spectrum slope for Halpha steepens with increasing star formation\nrate, ranging from a shallow value comparable to the noise at low rates to a\nsteep value with a slope of -1.5 at high rates. This change reflects the\nincreasing areal filling factor of Halpha emission with increasing star\nformation rate, and an apparently universal slope inside the Halpha regions\nthat is comparable to that for Kolmogorov turbulence. The power spectrum of HI\nin one galaxy has a steeper power law, with a slope of -2.9. The fact that the\npower laws of star formation are about the same for dwarf galaxies and giant\nspiral galaxies suggests the microscopic processes are the same, independent of\nspiral density waves and galaxy size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2005 20:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Both models are phenomenological ways to introduce decoherence in chaotic\nscattering by a quantum dot. The difference is that the dephasing lead opens up\nthe quantum dot by connecting it to an electron reservoir, while the dephasing\nstub is closed at one end. Voltage fluctuations in the stub take over the\ndephasing role from the reservoir. Because the quantum dot with dephasing lead\nis an open system, only expectation values of the current can be forced to\nvanish at low frequencies, while the outcome of an individual measurement is\nnot so constrained. The quantum dot with dephasing stub, in contrast, remains a\nclosed system with a vanishing low-frequency current at each and every\nmeasurement.
