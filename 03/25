The noise was measured by monitoring the\nconductance fluctuations around $e^2/h$ on the first step of a quantum point\ncontact at around 1.2 K. Cooling with a positive bias on the gates dramatically\nreduces this noise, while an asymmetric bias exacerbates it. We propose a model\nin which the noise originates from a leakage current of electrons that tunnel\nthrough the Schottky barrier under the gate into the doped layer. The key to\nreducing noise is to keep this barrier opaque under experimental conditions.\nBias cooling reduces the density of ionized donors, which builds in an\neffective negative gate voltage. A smaller negative bias is therefore needed to\nreach the desired operating point. This suppresses tunnelling from the gate and\nhence the noise. The reduction in the density of ionized donors also\nstrengthens the barrier to tunneling at a given applied voltage. Support for\nthe model comes from our direct observation of the leakage current into a\nclosed quantum dot, around $10^{-20} \\mathrm{A}$ for this device. The current\nwas detected by a neighboring quantum point contact, which showed monotonic\nsteps in time associated with the tunneling of single electrons into the dot.\nIf asymmetric gate voltages are applied, our model suggests that the noise will\nincrease as a consequence of the more negative gate voltage applied to one of\nthe gates to maintain the same device conductance.

However, one must reconsider the fundamental principles of statistical\nmechanics especially its key quantity, entropy. Whereas in conventional\nthermostatistics, the homogeneity and extensivity of the system and the\nconcavity of its entropy are central conditions, these fail for the systems\nconsidered here. For example, at phase separation, the entropy, S(E), is\nnecessarily convex to make exp[S(E)-E/T] bimodal in E. Particularly, as\ninhomogeneities and surface effects cannot be scaled away, one must be careful\nwith the standard arguments of splitting a system into two subsystems, or\nbringing two systems into thermal contact with energy or particle exchange. Not\nonly the volume part of the entropy must be considered. As will be shown here,\nwhen removing constraints in regions of a negative heat capacity, the system\nmay even relax under a flow of heat (energy) against a temperature slope. Thus\nthe Clausius formulation of the second law: ``Heat always flows from hot to\ncold'', can be violated. Temperature is not a necessary or fundamental control\nparameter of thermostatistics. However, the second law is still satisfied and\nthe total Boltzmann entropy increases. In the final sections of this paper, the\ngeneral microscopic mechanism leading to condensation and to the convexity of\nthe microcanonical entropy at phase separation is sketched. Also the\nmicroscopic conditions for the existence (or non-existence) of a critical\nend-point of the phase-separation are discussed.

We stress the existence of integrable structures on the two\nsides of the duality. In particular, we argue that the integrability of strings\nin AdS_5 x S^5 implies the integrability of the deformed world sheet theory\nwith real deformation parameter. We compare the fast string limit of the\nworldsheet action in the sector with two angular momenta with the continuum\nlimit of the coherent state action of an anisotropic XXZ spin chain describing\nthe one-loop anomalous dimensions of the corresponding operators and find a\nremarkable agreement for all values of the deformation parameter. We discuss\nsome of the properties of the Bethe Ansatz for this spin chain, solve the Bethe\nequations for small number of excitations and comment on higher loop properties\nof the dilatation operator. With the goal of going beyond the leading order in\nthe 't Hooft expansion we derive the analog of the Bethe equations on the\nstring-theory side, and show that they coincide with the thermodynamic limit of\nthe Bethe equations for the spin chain. We also compute the 1/J corrections to\nthe anomalous dimensions of operators with large R-charge (corresponding to\nstrings with angular momentum J) and match them to the 1-loop corrections to\nthe fast string energies. Our results suggest that the impressive agreement\nbetween the gauge theory and semiclassical strings in AdS_5 x S^5 is part of a\nlarger picture underlying the gauge/gravity duality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2005 18:51:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2005 19:51:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 May 2005 00:23:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2005 14:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

They are natural extensions of gradients of convex\nfunctions --hence of self-adjoint positive operators-- which usually drive\ndissipative systems, but also rich enough to provide representations for the\nsuperposition of such gradients with skew-symmetric operators which normally\ngenerate unitary flows. They yield variational formulations and resolutions for\nlarge classes of non-potential boundary value problems and initial-value\nparabolic equations. Solutions are minima of functionals of the form $I(u)=L(u,\n\\Lambda u)$ (resp. $I(u)=\\int_{0}^{T}L(t, u(t), \\dot u (t)+\\Lambda_{t}u(t))dt$)\nwhere $L$ is an anti-self dual Lagrangian and where $\\Lambda_{t}$ are\nessentially skew-adjoint operators. However, and just like the self (and\nantiself) dual equations of quantum field theory (e.g. Yang-Mills) the\nequations associated to such minima are not derived from the fact they are\ncritical points of the functional $I$, but because they are also zeroes of the\nLagrangian $L$ itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2005 22:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
