In this context application servers often form the\nbottleneck for a system's efficiency. An application server exposes an object\noriented interface consisting of set of methods which are accessed by\npotentially remote clients. The idea of method caching is to store results of\nread-only method invocations with respect to the application server's interface\non the client side. If the client invokes the same method with the same\narguments again, the corresponding result can be taken from the cache without\ncontacting the server. It has been shown that this approach can considerably\nimprove a real world system's efficiency.\n  This paper extends the concept of method caching by addressing the case where\nclients wrap related method invocations in ACID transactions. Demarcating\nsequences of method calls in this way is supported by many important\napplication server standards. In this context the paper presents an\narchitecture, a theory and an efficient protocol for maintaining full\ntransactional consistency and in particular serializability when using a method\ncache on the client side. In order to create a protocol for scheduling cached\nmethod results, the paper extends a classical transaction formalism. Based on\nthis extension, a recovery protocol and an optimistic serializability protocol\nare derived. The latter one differs from traditional transactional cache\nprotocols in many essential ways.

These hidden subgroup problems are typically solved by\nFourier sampling. When G is nonabelian, two important variants of Fourier\nsampling have been identified: the weak standard method, where only\nrepresentation names are measured, and the strong standard method, where full\nmeasurement (i.e., the row and column of the representation, in a suitably\nchosen basis) occurs. It has remained open whether the strong standard method\nis indeed stronger. In this article, we settle this question in the\naffirmative. We show that hidden subgroups H of the q-hedral groups, i.e.,\nsemidirect products Z_q \\ltimes Z_p where q | (p-1), and in particular the\naffine groups A_p, can be information-theoretically reconstructed using the\nstrong standard method.

A metrological analysis of all data permitted us to determine both\nthe random and systematic errors, and to find the total experimental error as a\nfunction of separation at the 95% confidence level. In contrast to all previous\nexperiments on the Casimir effect, our smallest experimental error ($\\sim\n0.5$%) is achieved over a wide separation range. The theoretical Casimir\npressures in the experimental configuration were calculated by the use of four\ntheoretical approaches suggested in the literature. All corrections to the\nCasimir force were calculated or estimated. All theoretical errors were\nanalyzed and combined to obtain the total theoretical error at the 95%\nconfidence level. Finally, the confidence interval for the differences between\ntheoretical and experimental pressures was obtained as a function of\nseparation. Our measurements are found to be consistent with two theoretical\napproaches utilizing the plasma model and the surface impedance over the entire\nmeasurement region. Two other approaches to the thermal Casimir force,\nutilizing the Drude model or a special prescription for the determination of\nthe zero-frequency contribution to the Lifshitz formula, are excluded on the\nbasis of our measurements at the 99% and 95% confidence levels, respectively.\nFinally, constraints on Yukawa-type hypothetical interactions are strengthened\nby up to a factor of 20 in a wide interaction range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2005 13:54:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2005 13:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
