The resulting color-magnitude diagram reaches\ndown to I~26.0 mag. It reveals not only a young population of blue\nmain-sequence stars (age <30 Myr) but also an intermediate-age population of\nblue and red supergiants (20 Myr<age<100 Myr), and an older evolved populations\nof asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (age >100 Myr) and red giant branch\n(RGB) stars (age >1 Gyr). The measured magnitude I=23.65+/-0.10 mag of the RGB\ntip results in a distance modulus m-M=27.67+/-0.10, which corresponds to a\ndistance of 3.42+/-0.15 Mpc, in agreement with previous distance\ndeterminations. The youngest stars are associated with the bright complex of\nHII regions NGC 2363=Mrk 71 in the southwest extremity of the galaxy. As a\nconsequence of the diffusion and relaxation processes of stellar ensembles, the\nolder the stellar population is, the smoother and more extended is its spatial\ndistribution. An underlying population of older stars is found throughout the\nbody of NGC 2366. The most notable feature of this older population is the\npresence of numerous relatively bright AGB stars. The number ratio of AGB to\nRGB stars and the average absolute brightness of AGB stars in NGC 2366 are\nappreciably higher than in the BCD VII Zw 403, indicating a younger age of the\nAGB stars in NGC 2366. In addition to the present burst of age <100 Myr, there\nhas been strong star formation activity in the past of NGC 2366, from ~100 Myr\nto <3 Gyr ago.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2005 22:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
