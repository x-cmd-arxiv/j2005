Given the instability of such a state within the\ncontext of general relativity, this amounts to a very severe fine tuning. Also\nin order to be able to study the dynamics of the universe within the context of\ngeneral relativity, they set the initial conditions for the universe in the\nclassical phase.

Although a vast number of\nmodels have been developed in order to extract biological knowledge from\ncomplex systems composed of basic elements as proteins, genes and chemical\ncompounds, a need remains for improving our understanding of dynamical features\nof the systems (i.e., temporal-dependence).\n  In this article, we analyze the gene expression dynamics (i.e., how the genes\nexpression fluctuates in time) by using a new constructive approach. This\napproach is based on only two fundamental ingredients: symmetry and the Markov\nproperty of dynamics. First, by using experimental data of human and yeast gene\nexpression time series, we found a symmetry in short-time transition\nprobability from time $t$ to time $t+1$. We call it self-similarity symmetry\n(i.e., surprisingly, the gene expression short-time fluctuations contain a\nrepeating pattern of smaller and smaller parts that are like the whole, but\ndifferent in size). Secondly, the Markov property of dynamics reflects that the\nshort-time fluctuation governs the full-time behaviour of the system. Here, we\nsucceed in reconstructing naturally the global behavior of the observed\ndistribution of gene expression (i.e., scaling-law) and the local behaviour of\nthe power-law tail of this distribution, by using only these two ingredients:\nsymmetry and the Markov property of dynamics.

Rev. A 64, 012310 (2001)]. The main difficulty of this\ncontinuous variable encoding relies on the physical generation of the quantum\ncodewords. We show that ponderomotive interaction suffices to this end. As a\nmatter of fact, this kind of interaction between a system and a meter causes a\nfrequency change on the meter proportional to the position quadrature of the\nsystem. Then, a phase measurement of the meter leaves the system in an\neigenstate of the stabilizer generators, provided that system and meter's\ninitial states are suitably prepared. Here we show how to implement this\ninteraction using trapped ions, and how the encoding can be performed on their\nmotional degrees of freedom. The robustness of the codewords with respect to\nthe various experimental imperfections is then analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2005 14:40:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2005 13:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It seems that either the choice of vector along which one projects\nthe spin of the first particle influences at superluminal speed the state of\nthe second particle, or naive realism holds true i.e., the projections of the\nspin of any EPR particle along all the vectors are determined before any\nmeasurement occurs). Naive realism is negated by Bell's theory that originated\nand is still most often presented as related to non-locality, a relation whose\nnecessity has recently been proven to be false. I advocate here that the\nsolution of the apparent paradox lies in the fact that the spin of the second\nparticle is determined along any vector, but not along all vectors. Such an\nany-all distinction was already present in quantum mechanics, for instance in\nthe fact that the spin can be measured along any vector but not at once along\nall vectors, as a result of the Uncertainty Principle. The time symmetry of the\nany-all distinction defended here is in fact reminiscent of (and I claim, due\nto) the time symmetry of the Uncertainty Principle described by Einstein,\nTolman, and Podolsky in 1931, in a paper entitled ``Knowledge of Past and\nFuture in Quantum Mechanics\" that is enough to negate naive realism and to hint\nat the any-all distinction. A simple classical model is next built, which\ncaptures aspects of the any-all distinction: the goal is of course not to have\na classical exact model, but to provide a caricature that might help some\npeople.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2005 06:38:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2005 09:18:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the first feedback\nscheme, the output from the quantum system to be controlled is fed back into\nthe distant actuator via teleportation to alter the dynamics of system. The\nresult theoretically shows that it can accomplish some tasks such as distant\nfeedback quantum control that Markovian or Bayesian quantum feedback can't\ncomplete.
