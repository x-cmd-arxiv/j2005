The possibility of\nmanipulating the Fano lineshape in the tunnelling spectra of the DQD system is\nexplored by tuning the dot-lead coupling, the inter-dot coupling, the magnetic\nflux threading the ring connecting dots and leads, and the flux difference\nbetween two sub-rings. It has been found that by making use of various tuning,\nthe direction of the asymmetric tail of Fano lineshape may be flipped by\nexternal fields, and the continuous conductance spectra may be magnetically\nmanipulated with lineshape retained. More importantly, by adjusting the\nmagnetic flux, the function of two molecular states can be exchanged, giving\nrise to a swap effect, which might play a role as a qubit in the quantum\ncomputation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2005 09:50:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2005 06:12:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2005 02:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

The\nprocedure is illustrated by application to the gx2+x2N (N a positive integer)\noscillator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2005 12:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
