However, most of the low-density intergalactic gas that\ndetermines the observed properties of the Ly-alpha forest is unaffected by\nwinds. The impact of winds on the Ly-alpha optical depth near galaxies is less\ndramatic than their impact on gas temperature because winds heat only a small\nfraction of the gas present in the turnaround regions surrounding galaxies.\nHence, Ly-alpha absorption from gas outside the wind bubbles is spread out over\nthe same velocity range occupied by the wind-heated gas.

The XMM-Newton MOS spectrum shows two-temperature thermal plasma\nemission characteristics of both the forward (4.1 keV) and reverse shock (0.78\nkeV) with no intrinsic absorption. The long-term X-ray lightcurve of SN 1979C\nshows no sign of a decline over 16-23 yrs after its outburst. The high X-ray\nluminosity (8 x 10^38 ergs/s) is caused by the interaction of the shock with\ndense circumstellar matter, likely deposited by a strong stellar wind from the\nprogenitor with a high mass-loss rate of 1.5 x 10^-4 M_sun/yr. The X-ray data\nsupport a strongly decelerated shock and show a mass-loss rate history which is\nconsistent with a constant progenitor mass-loss rate and wind velocity over the\npast >16,000 yrs in the evolution of the progenitor. We find a CSM density\nprofile of rho_CSM \\propto r^-s with index s<1.7 and high CSM densities (>10^4\ncm^-3) out to large radii from the site of the explosion (> 4 x 10^17 cm).\nUsing XMM-Newton Optical Monitor data we further detect optical/UV emission\nfrom SN 1979C, with B, U, and UVW1-band lum. of 5,7, and 9 x 10^36 ergs/s. The\nyoung stellar cluster in the vicinity of the SN, as imaged by the HST and\nfollow-up ground-based optical imaging, can only provide a fraction of the\ntotal observed flux, so that a significant contribution to the output likely\narises from the strong interaction of SN 1979C with dense CSM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2005 21:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Secondly, we compute the XANES spectra at three\ndifferent temperatures, 90 K, 300 K, and 530 K and quantify the change in terms\nof the difference spectrum. We note that in this compound the tetragonality\nincreases almost monotonically with temperature from 12 K to 570 K without\ntransition to the cubic phase under ambient pressure. A key objective of the\ncurrent investigation is to gain an understanding of various absorption\nfeatures in the vicinity of K-edge of V, in terms of valence, local site\nsymmetry, local coordination geometry, local bond distances, charge transfer,\nand local projected density of states. We consider both the polarized and the\nunpolarized XANES spectra. In short we have performed a local electronic study,\nwhich nicely complements the crystallographic features reported recently in\nPbVO3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2005 08:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, this scenario is not fully\nconfirmed by the dynamical mean-field theory calculation, which shows that,\nalthough the quasiparticle residue of the narrower band is zero within our\nnumerical accuracy, low-energy spectral weight still exists inside the\nMott-Hubbard gap, concentrated into two peaks symmetric around the chemical\npotential. This spectral weight vanishes only when the wider band ceases to\nconduct too. Although our results are compatible with several scenarios, e.g.,\na narrow gap semiconductor or a semimetal, we argue that the most plausible one\nis that the two peaks coexist with a narrow resonance tied at the chemical\npotential, with a spectral weight below our numerical accuracy.

For\nthe cold part, we assign a fitting formula for realistic EOSs of cold nuclear\nmatter slightly modifying the formula developed by Haensel and Potekhin. We\nadopt the SLy and FPS EOSs for which the maximum allowed ADM mass of cold and\nspherical neutron stars (NSs) is ~ 2.04Mo and 1.80Mo, respectively. Simulations\nare performed for BNSs of the total ADM mass in the range between 2.4Mo and\n2.8Mo with the rest-mass ratio Q_M to be in the range 0.9 < Q_M < 1. It is\nfound that if the total ADM mass of the system is larger than a threshold\nM_{thr}, a black hole (BH) is promptly formed in the merger irrespective of the\nmass ratios. In the other case, the outcome is a hypermassive NS of a large\nellipticity, which results from the large adiabatic index of the realistic EOSs\nadopted. The value of M_{thr} depends on the EOS: ~ 2.7Mo and ~ 2.5Mo for the\nSLy and FPS EOSs, respectively. Gravitational waves are computed in terms of a\ngauge-invariant wave extraction technique. In the formation of the hypermassive\nNS, quasiperiodic gravitational waves of a large amplitude and of frequency\nbetween 3 and 4 kHz are emitted.

One crucial aspect\nof U(1)' models is the existence of anomalies, cancellation of which may\nrequire the inclusion of exotic matter which in turn disrupts the unification\nof the gauge couplings. In this work we pursue the question of canceling the\nanomalies with a minimal matter spectrum and no exotics. This can indeed be\nrealized provided that U(1)' charges are family-dependent and the soft-breaking\nsector includes non-holomorphic operators for generating the fermion masses.
