Statistical mechanics has two crucial requirements for equilibrium:\nstatistical independence of macro-cells (subsystems) and additivity of\ninvariants of macro-cells. We use additivity to select the appropriate Casimir\ninvariants from the infinite set available in vortex dynamics, and we do this\nin such a way that the exchange of micro-cells within a macro-cell does not\nalter an invariant of a macro-cell. A novel feature of the present study is our\nchoice of macro-cells, which are continuous phase space curves based on mean\nvalues of the streamfunction.

The\npresence of the RTD within the waveguide core introduces high non-linearity and\nnegative differential resistance in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of\nthe waveguide. This makes the electric field distribution across the waveguide\ncore strongly dependent on the bias voltage: when the current decreases from\nthe peak to the valley there is an increase of the electric field across the\ndepleted core. The electric field enhancement in the core-depleted layer causes\nthe Franz-Keldysh absorption band-edge to red shift, which is responsible for\nthe electroabsorption effect.

We define\nnon-integrable quantum systems as those which have, as their classical limit, a\nnon-integrable classical system. In order to obtain this limit, the\nself-induced decoherence approach and the corresponding classical limit are\ngeneralized from integrable to non-integrable systems. In this approach, the\nlost of information, usually conceived as the result of a coarse-graining or\nthe trace of an environment, is produced by a particular choice of the algebra\nof observables and the systematic use of mean values, that project the unitary\nevolution onto an effective non-unitary one. The decoherence times computed\nwith this approach coincide with those of the literature. By means of our\nmethod, we can obtain the classical limit of the quantum state of a\nnon-integrable system, which turns out to be a set of unstable, potentially\nchaotic classical trajectories contained in the Wigner transformation of the\nquantum state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2005 13:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
