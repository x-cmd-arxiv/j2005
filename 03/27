For hot stars,\nHe^0/He^+ is 2 -- 3%, much larger than with uniform models. This amount of He I\nis independent of metallicity and so impacts the determination of the\nprimordial abundance of He. The total abundances of O, Ne, and S obtained by\nthe usual methods of analysis, using T([OIII) for high stages of ionization and\nT([NII]) for low, are about as accurate for clumped models as for uniform and\nwithin about 20% of the true values. If T([OIII]) is used for analyzing all\nions, the derived (O/H) is 40 to 60% too large for cool stars but is good for\nhot stars. Uniform models have similar errors, so the clumping does not change\nthe accuracy of abundance analysis.\n  The physical causes of the ionic abundance errors are present in real\nnebulae. In clumped models, helium ionizing radiation from zones of high\nionization (low He^0 and low UV opacity) can penetrate nearby regions near the\nedge of the ionized zone. This effect allows He^0 to absorb more stellar\nphotons than in uniform or radially symmetrical geometries. In turn, these\nabsorptions compete with O+, etc., for those energetic stellar photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2005 16:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
