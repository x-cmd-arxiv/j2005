In fact, its structure proves to be simple and regular. An\nanalysis in terms of the Friedmann integral enables to recognize a remarkably\nsimple time-independent covariant robust recipe of the cosmic mix: the\nnumerical values of the Friedmann integral for vacuum, dark matter, baryons and\nradiation are approximately identical. The identity may be treated as a\nsymmetry relation that unifies cosmic energies into a regular set, a quartet,\nwith the Friedmann integral as its common genuine time-independent physical\nparameter. Such cosmic internal (non-geometrical) symmetry exists whenever\ncosmic energies themselves exist in nature. It is most natural for a finite\nUniverse suggested by the WMAP data. A link to fundamental theory may be found\nunder the assumption about a special significance of the electroweak energy\nscale in both particle physics and cosmology. A freeze-out model developed on\nthis basis demonstrates that the physical nature of new symmetry might be due\nto the interplay between electroweak physics and gravity at the cosmic age of a\nfew picoseconds. The big `hierarchy number' of particle physics represents the\ninterplay in the model. This number quantifies the Friedmann integral and gives\nalso a measure to some other basic cosmological figures and phenomena\nassociated with new symmetry. In this way, cosmic internal symmetry provides a\ncommon ground for better understanding of old and recent problems that\notherwise seem unrelated; the coincidence of the observed cosmic densities, the\nflatness of the co-moving space, the initial perturbations and their amplitude,\nthe cosmic entropy are among them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2005 17:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We perform numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to study how\nsupernovae feedback strength, supermassive black hole growth and feedback,\nprogenitor gas fraction, merger mass-ratio, and orbital geometry impact the\nformation of remnant disks. We find that disks can build angular momentum\nthrough mergers and the degree of rotational support of the baryons in the\nmerger remnant is primarily related to feedback processes associated with star\nformation. Disk-dominated remnants are restricted to form in mergers that are\ngas-dominated at the time of final coalescence and gas-dominated mergers\ntypically require extreme progenitor gas fractions (>80%).

The astrospheric absorption is of particular\ninterest because it can be used to study solar-like stellar winds that are\notherwise undetectable. We find and analyze 33 HST Lyman-alpha spectra in the\narchive. All the spectra were taken with the E140M grating of the Space\nTelescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on board HST. The HST/STIS\nspectra yield 4 new detections of heliospheric absorption (70 Oph, Xi Boo, 61\nVir, and HD 165185) and 7 new detections of astrospheric absorption (EV Lac, 70\nOph, Xi Boo, 61 Vir, Delta Eri, HD 128987, and DK UMa), doubling the previous\nnumber of heliospheric and astrospheric detections.

Here we develop a full\ndescription of the evolution of the energy distribution of relativistic\nelectrons in a plasma divided into two distinct regions with different\nstrengths of the magnetic field. Electrons are able to continuously leak from\nthe low-field region into the high-field region. The model becomes fully\nanalytic for physically reasonable assumptions.

These spectra are consistent with\nspatially resolved observations of the radio spectra of the lobes of radio\ngalaxies.
