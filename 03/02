Because the disk radiates at its Eddington limit, the Schmidt-law for\nstar formation changes in the optically-thick limit, with the star formation\nrate per unit area scaling as Sigma_g/kappa, where Sigma_g is the gas surface\ndensity and kappa is the mean opacity.

In\nsuch a case it is usually supposed that the stress is attributable to pinning\nof superfluid vortices to crust nuclei, but it has been suggested that, even if\nthe pinning effect is too weak, a comparably large stress might still arise\njust from the deficit of centrifugal buoyancy in the slowed down crust. The\npresent work is a re-examination that investigates the way such processes may\nbe affected by considerations that were overlooked in the previous work --\nnotably uncertainties about the ``effective'' masses that have to be attributed\nto the ``free'' superfluid neutrons to allow for their entrainment by the ionic\ncrust material.

We propose a\ntwo-phase model that is novel in that it introduces the concept of verification\nand validation (V&V) early in the requirements life cycle. In the first phase,\nwe perform V&V immediately following the elicitation of requirements for each\nindividually distinct system function. Because the first phase focuses on\ncapturing smaller sets of related requirements iteratively, each corresponding\nV&V activity is better focused for detecting and correcting errors in each\nrequirement set. In the second phase, a complementary verification activity is\ninitiated; the corresponding focus is on the quality of linkages between\nrequirements sets rather than on the requirements within the sets.\nConsequently, this approach reduces the effort in verification and enhances the\nfocus on the verification task. Our approach, unlike other models, has a\nminimal time delay between the elicitation of requirements and the execution of\nthe V&V activities. Because of this short time gap, the stakeholders have a\nclearer recollection of the requirements, their context and rationale; this\nenhances the stakeholder feedback. Furthermore, our model includes activities\nthat closely align with the effective RE processes employed in the software\nindustry. Thus, our approach facilitates a better understanding of the flow of\nrequirements, and provides guidance for the implementation of the RE process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2005 00:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper, we\npropose a simple model for studying bottleneck effects of lane-changing traffic\nand aggregate traffic dynamics of a roadway with lane-changing areas. Based on\nthe observation that, when changing its lane, a vehicle affects traffic on both\nits current and target lanes, we propose to capture such lateral interactions\nby introducing a new lane-changing intensity variable. With a modified\nfundamental diagram, we are able to study the impacts of lane-changing traffic\non overall traffic flow. In addition, the corresponding traffic dynamics can be\ndescribed with a simple kinematic wave model. For a location-dependent\nlane-changing intensity variable, we discuss kinematic wave solutions of the\nRiemann problem of the new model and introduce a supply-demand method for its\nnumerical solutions. With both theoretical and empirical analysis, we\ndemonstrate that lane-changes could have significant bottleneck effects on\noverall traffic flow. In the future, we will be interested in studying\nlane-changing intensities for different road geometries, locations,\non-ramp/off-ramp flows, as well as traffic conditions. The new modeling\nframework could be helpful for developing ramp metering and other lane\nmanagement strategies to mitigate the bottleneck effects of lane-changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2005 12:57:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 18:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-14"}
