Special\nrelativistic aberration due to the orbital motion of pulsar changes both the\nlongitude and colatitude of the emission direction with respect to the pulsar\nspin axis. The former gives rise to a shift of the arrival time of the pulse\ncentroid (this is the conventional ``longitudinal'' aberration delay), the\nlatter results in a distortion (contraction or dilation) of the pulse profile\non the orbital timescale. The amplitude of pulse distortion depends inversely\non the variation of polarization position angle across the pulse. For small\nangle between the pulsar magnetic and spin axes, as inferred for PSR\nJ0737-3039A from polarimetric observations, the pulse distortion is significant\n(\\sim 1%) and the associated ``latitudinal'' aberration delay is much larger\nthan the longitudinal one. By monitoring the arrival time of separate pulse\ncomponents as a function of pulsar orbital phase, the latitudinal aberration\ndelay may be easily measured with the current timing precision, thus\nconstraining the spin geometry of the system. The latitudinal delay can also be\ndetected by monitoring system's orbital parameters on the geodetic precession\ntimescale. Because of the near edge-on orbital orientation of the PSR\nJ0737-3039 system, general relativistic bending of pulsar A's radio beam near\nits superior conjunction also introduces spin-dependent time delays of similar\norder of magnitude as the aberration delays. In addition, light bending splits\nthe pulse profile into two variable components, corresponding to two\ngravitationally lensed images of the source.

If grain growth during the classical T Tauri phase\nproduces plenty of millimeter sized grains, such grains completely accrete onto\nthe star in 10^7 yr, before photoevaporation begins to drain the inner gas disk\nand the star evolves to the weak line T Tauri phase. In the weak line phase,\nonly dust-poor gas disks remain at large radii (> 10 AU), without strong signs\nof gas accretion nor of millimeter thermal emission from the dust.

For low mass stars with a low photoevaporation rate, dust-poor gas\ndisks with an inner hole would form, whereas for high mass stars with a high\nphotoevaporation rate, gas-poor dust rings would form.

The nature (thermal vs non-thermal) of the hard part of the spectrum\nis not unambiguously revealed by our data. If the emission is thermal, the high\ntemperature of the plasma (~ 2.3 10^7 to 4.6 10^7 K) would be typical of what\nshould be expected from a wind-wind interaction zone within a long period\nbinary system. This emission could arise from an interaction between the\ncombined winds of the O5-8V + O5-8V close binary system and that of the more\ndistant O8I companion. Assuming instead that the hard part of the spectrum is\nnon-thermal, the photon index would be rather steep (~3). Moreover, a marginal\nvariability between our two XMM-Newton pointings could be attributed to an\neclipse of the O5-8V + O5-8V system. The overall X-ray luminosity points to a\nsignificant X-ray luminosity excess of about a factor 4 possibly due to\ncolliding winds.

The\nresulting steady states differ dramatically depending on which dynamical rule\nis used. We show that the commonly used driven diffusive Metropolis Monte Carlo\ndynamics contains unphysical intrinsic randomness that destroys the spatial\nordering present in equilibrium (the vortex lattice) over most of the driven\nphase diagram. A continuous time Monte Carlo (CTMC) is then developed, which\nresults in spatially ordered driven states at low temperature in finite sized\nsystems.

Unlike the mean vdW force that is\ndetermined by all quantum states that contribute to the optical absorption, the\nenergies of those excitations of the interacting bodies that contribute\neffectively to the vdW force noise are thermal energies. Contrary to the mean\nvdW force the vdW force noise drops with decreasing temperature. Due to these\ndifferences the main mechanism of the mean vdW force and that of the vdW force\nnoise may be different, e.g., the mean vdW force is determined by electronic\nxcitations, the force noise by the random lattice or impurity dynamics. Since\nthe vdW force is linear in the fields squared the dependence of the vdW force\nnoise correlation function on time difference is determined not by one but by\ntwo frequencies: the spectral density depends not only on the frequency of its\nmeasurement but also on the integral over the second frequency. The dependence\nof its integrand on this frequency and emperature is quantum-like even at small\nmeasurement frequency, and such may be the behavior of the vdW noise. In the\ncase of interacting metals the vdW force noise is enhanced by dc voltage\napplied across these metals. This additional noise is proportional to the\nvoltage squared and to the spectral density of the random electric field at the\nfrequency of noise measurement. The theory is in qualitative agreement with\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2005 17:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These\njunctions consist of two metal electrodes separated by a nanometer-thick\nferroelectric barrier. The current-voltage characteristics of FTJs are analyzed\nunder the assumption that the direct electron tunneling represents the dominant\nconduction mechanism. First, the influence of converse piezoelectric effect\ninherent in ferroelectric materials on the tunnel current is described. The\ncalculations show that the lattice strains of piezoelectric origin modify the\ncurrent-voltage relationship owing to strain-induced changes of the barrier\nthickness, electron effective mass, and position of the conduction-band edge.\nRemarkably, the conductance minimum becomes shifted from zero voltage due to\nthe piezoelectric effect, and a strain-related resistive switching takes place\nafter the polarization reversal in a ferroelectric barrier. Second, we analyze\nthe influence of the internal electric field arising due to imperfect screening\nof polarization charges by electrons in metal electrodes. It is shown that, for\nasymmetric FTJs, this depolarizing-field effect also leads to a considerable\nchange of the barrier resistance after the polarization reversal. However, the\nsymmetry of the resulting current-voltage loop is different from that\ncharacteristic of the strain-related resistive switching. The crossover from\none to another type of the hysteretic curve, which accompanies the increase of\nFTJ asymmetry, is described taking into account both the strain and\ndepolarizing-field effects. It is noted that asymmetric FTJs with dissimilar\ntop and bottom electrodes are preferable for the non-volatile memory\napplications because of a larger resistance on/off ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2005 11:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Initial motivation for playing\ngames, in the quantum world, comes from the possibility of re-formulating\nquantum communication protocols, and algorithms, in terms of games between\nquantum and classical players. The possibility led to the view that quantum\ngames have a potential to provide helpful insight into working of quantum\nalgorithms, and even in finding new ones. This thesis analyzes and compares\nsome interesting games when played classically and quantum mechanically. A\nlarge part of the thesis concerns investigations into a refinement notion of\nthe Nash equilibrium concept. The refinement, called an evolutionarily stable\nstrategy (ESS), was originally introduced in 1970s by mathematical biologists\nto model an evolving population using techniques borrowed from game theory.\nAnalysis is developed around a situation when quantization changes ESSs without\naffecting corresponding Nash equilibria. Effects of quantization on\nsolution-concepts other than Nash equilibrium are presented and discussed. For\nthis purpose the notions of value of coalition, backwards-induction outcome,\nand subgame-perfect outcome are selected. Repeated games are known to have\ndifferent information structure than one-shot games. Investigation is presented\ninto a possible way where quantization changes the outcome of a repeated game.\nLastly, two new suggestions are put forward to play quantum versions of\nclassical matrix games. The first one uses the association of De Broglie's\nwaves, with travelling material objects, as a resource for playing a quantum\ngame. The second suggestion concerns an EPR type setting exploiting directly\nthe correlations in Bell's inequalities to play a bi-matrix game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2005 19:01:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2005 19:35:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2005 13:53:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2006 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
