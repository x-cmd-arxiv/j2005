RRAT J1819--1458 is a relatively highly magnetized (B\n$\\sim 5\\times10^{13}$ G) member of a new class of unusual pulsar-like objects\ndiscovered by their bursting activity at radio wavelengths. The position of\nRRAT J1819--1458 was serendipitously observed by the {\\sl Chandra} ACIS-I\ncamera in 2005 May. At that position we have discovered a pointlike source,\nCXOU J181934.1--145804, with a soft spectrum well fit by an absorbed blackbody\nwith $N_H = 7^{+7}_{-4} \\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ and temperature $kT=0.12 \\pm\n0.04$ keV, having an unabsorbed flux of $\\sim2 \\times 10^{-12}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ between 0.5 and 8 keV. No optical or infrared (IR) counterparts are\nvisible within $1''$ of our X-ray position. The positional coincidence,\nspectral properties, and lack of an optical/IR counterpart make it highly\nlikely that CXOU J181934.1--145804 is a neutron star and is the same object as\nRRAT J1819--1458. The source showed no variability on any timescale from the\npulse period of 4.26~s up to the five-day window covered by the observations,\nalthough our limits (especially for pulsations) are not particularly\nconstraining. The X-ray properties of CXOU J181934.1--145804, while not yet\nmeasured to high precision, are similar to those of comparably-aged radio\npulsars and are consistent with thermal emission from a cooling neutron star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2005 22:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The detection, thanks to the INTEGRAL satellite, of a number of new\nhard X-ray sources calls for the identification of their nature by means of\nobservations at longer wavelengths.\n  Aims. In our continuing campaign to identify longer-wavelength counterparts\nof these newly-discovered hard X-ray sources detected by INTEGRAL, we observed\nthe putative optical counterparts of seven southern sources at the South\nAfrican Astronomical Observatory and at the European Southern Observatory.\n  Methods. Optical spectroscopy was performed on all candidates of these X-ray\nsources. For two of these objects, optical photometry was also acquired.\n  Results. These observations firmly established the nature of four of these\nsources: we found that IGR J10404-4625 (=LEDA 93974), 4U 1344-60 and IGR\nJ16482-3036 are Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at redshifts z = 0.0237, 0.013\nand 0.0313, respectively, and that 2RXP J130159.6-635806 is a Galactic\nHigh-Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB).

The source of irradiation consists in highly\ncoherent VUV pulses obtained through high order harmonic generation of a high\nintensity femtosecond pulse at a 1.55 eV photon energy (titanium-doped sapphire\nlaser). Harmonics H9 to H17 have been used for photoconductivity (PC) and\nharmonics H13 to H27 for photoemission experiments (PES).

We show that the inverse map of a point in\nsignature space consists of a number of isolated islands in parameter space,\nindicating the existence of \"degeneracies\"--qualitatively different models with\nthe same LHC signatures. The degeneracies have simple physical\ncharacterizations, largely reflecting discrete ambiguities in electroweak-ino\nspectrum, accompanied by small adjustments for the remaining soft parameters.\nThe number of degeneracies falls in the range 1<d<100, depending on whether or\nnot sleptons are copiously produced in cascade decays. This number is large\nenough to represent a clear challenge but small enough to encourage looking for\nnew observables that can further break the degeneracies and determine at the\nLHC most of the SUSY physics we care about. Degeneracies occur because\nsignatures are not independent, and our approach allows testing of any new\nsignature for its independence.

The\nBotswana antiretroviral program began in 2002 and currently treats 34,000\npatients with a goal of treating 85,000 patients (~30% of HIV-infected adults)\nby 2009. We predict the evolution of drug-resistant strains of HIV that may\nemerge as a consequence of this treatment program. We discuss the implications\nof our results for the World Health Organization's (WHO's) proposed\nsurveillance system for detecting drug-resistant strains of HIV in Africa.\nMethods: We use a mathematical model of the emergence of drug resistance. We\nincorporate demographic and treatment data to make specific predictions as to\nwhen the WHO surveillance threshold is likely to be exceeded. Results: Our\nresults show - even if rates of acquired resistance are high, but the\ndrug-resistant strains that evolve are only half as transmissible as wild-type\nstrains - that transmission of drug-resistant strains will remain low (< 5% by\n2009) and are unlikely to exceed the WHO's surveillance threshold.

This general problem\nincludes the special case of solving a one-dimensional Schroedinger equation\nwith a given potential for the ground state energy.\n  The Sturm-Liouville problem depends on a function q, which, in the case of\nthe Schroedinger equation, can be identified with the potential function V.\nRecently Papageorgiou and Wozniakowski proved that quantum computers achieve an\nexponential reduction in the number of queries over the number needed in the\nclassical worst-case and randomized settings for smooth functions q. Their\nmethod uses the (discretized) unitary propagator and arbitrary powers of it as\na query (\"power queries\"). They showed that the Sturm-Liouville equation can be\nsolved with O(log(1/e)) power queries, while the number of queries in the\nworst-case and randomized settings on a classical computer is polynomial in\n1/e. This proves that a quantum computer with power queries achieves an\nexponential reduction in the number of queries compared to a classical\ncomputer.\n  In this paper we show that the number of queries in Papageorgiou's and\nWozniakowski's algorithm is asymptotically optimal. In particular we prove a\nmatching lower bound of log(1/e) power queries, therefore showing that log(1/e)\npower queries are sufficient and necessary. Our proof is based on a frequency\nanalysis technique, which examines the probability distribution of the final\nstate of a quantum algorithm and the dependence of its Fourier transform on the\ninput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2005 18:04:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2006 22:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Our main assumption is that the physical system we are\nworking with consists of several identifiable sub-systems, on which we can\napply some given gates locally.\n  To achieve our goal we define the notions of simulation and equivalence. The\nconcept of simulation refers to producing the correct probabilities when\nmeasuring physical systems. To enable the efficient testing of the composition\nof quantum operations, we introduce the notion of equivalence. Unlike\nsimulation, which refers to measured quantities (i.e., probabilities of\noutcomes), equivalence relates mathematical objects like states, subspaces or\ngates.\n  Using these two concepts, we prove that if a system satisfies some simulation\nconditions, then it is equivalent to the one it is purposed to implement. In\naddition, with our formalism, we can show that these statements are robust, and\nthe degree of robustness can be made explicit (unlike the robustness results of\n[DMMS00]). In particular, we also prove the robustness of the EPR Test [MY98].\nFinally, we design a test for any quantum circuit whose complexity is linear in\nthe number of gates and qubits, and polynomial in the required precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2005 20:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
