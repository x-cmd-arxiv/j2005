In particular, we have examined the cases of L_cut =\nf_cut L_box with f_cut=1 (i.e. no truncation), 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4. In common with\nprevious studies, we find that the suppression of long wavelength perturbations\nreduces the strength of clustering, as measured by a suppression of the 2-point\ncorrelation function xi(r), and reduces the numbers of the most massive haloes,\nas reflected in the depletion of the high mass end of the mass function n(M).\nInterestingly, we find that truncation has little impact on the internal\nproperties of haloes. The masses of high mass haloes decrease in a systematic\nmanner as L_cut is reduced, but the distribution of concentrations is\nunaffected. On the other hand, the median spin parameter is ~50% lower in runs\nwith f_cut<1. We argue that this is an imprint of the linear growth phase of\nthe halo's angular momentum by tidal torquing, and that the absence of any\nmeasurable trend in concentration and the weak trend observed in halo shape\nreflect the importance of virialisation and complex mass accretion histories\nfor these quantities.

The\ncolloid is modeled as a big hard sphere and the membrane is represented as an\ninfinitely thin surface which is fully permeable to one of the smaller spheres\nand impermeable to the other one. Within the framework of the density\nfunctional theory we evaluate the depletion potentials, and we consider two\ndifferent approximate theories - the simple Asakura-Oosawa approximation and\nthe accurate White-Bear version of the fundamental measure theory. The\neffective potentials are compared with the corresponding potentials for a hard,\nnonpermeable wall. Using statistical-mechanical sum rules we argue that the\ncontact value of the depletion potential between a colloid and a semipermeable\nmembrane is smaller in magnitude than the potential between a colloid and a\nhard wall. Explicit calculations confirm that the colloid-semipermeable\nmembrane effective interactions are generally weaker than these near a hard\nnonpermeable wall. This effect is more pronounced for smaller osmotic\npressures. The depletion potential for a colloidal particle inside a\nsemipermeable vesicle is stronger than the potential for the colloidal particle\nlocated outside of a vesicle. We find that the asymptotic decay of the\ndepletion potential for the semipermeable membrane is similar to that for the\nnonpermeable wall and reflects the asymptotics of the total correlation\nfunction of the corresponding binary mixture of smaller spheres. Our results\ndemonstrate that the ability of the membrane to change its shape constitutes an\nimportant factor in determining the effective interactions between the\nsemipermeable membrane and the colloidal macroparticle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2005 14:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To find the\ncomplete solution set, most of these solvers alternate the pruning steps with\nbranching steps, which split each problem into subproblems. This forms the\nso-called branch-and-prune framework, well known among the approaches for\nsolving numerical constraints. The basic branch-and-prune search strategy that\nuses domain bisections in place of the branching steps is called the bisection\nsearch. In general, the bisection search works well in case (i) the solutions\nare isolated, but it can be improved further in case (ii) there are continuums\nof solutions (this often occurs when inequalities are involved). In this paper,\nwe propose a new branch-and-prune search strategy along with several variants,\nwhich not only allow yielding better branching decisions in the latter case,\nbut also work as well as the bisection search does in the former case.

This result gives us the first\nsufficient condition and an information-theoretic solution for the following\nquantum state distinction problem: given an a priori known ensemble of quantum\nstates, is there a single POVM that gives reasonably large total variation\ndistance between every pair of states from the ensemble? Our random POVM method\nalso gives us the first information-theoretic upper bound on the number of\ncopies required to solve the quantum state identification problem for general\nensembles, i.e., given some number of independent copies of a quantum state\nfrom an a priori known ensemble, identify the state. The standard quantum\napproach to solving the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) is a special case of the\nstate identification problem where the ensemble consists of so-called coset\nstates of candidate hidden subgroups. Combining Fourier sampling with our\nrandom POVM result gives us single register algorithms using polynomially many\ncopies of the coset state that identify hidden subgroups having polynomially\nbounded rank in every representation of the ambient group. These HSP algorithms\ncomplement earlier results about the powerlessness of random Fourier sampling\nwhen the ranks are exponentially large, which happens for example in the HSP\nover the symmetric group. The drawback of random Fourier sampling based\nalgorithms is that they are not efficient because measuring in a random basis\nis not. This leads us to the open question of efficiently implementable\npseudo-random measurement bases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2005 05:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
