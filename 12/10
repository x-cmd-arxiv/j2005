The novel feature of the model is the use of the\nmaximum circular velocity at the time of accretion, V_max,acc, for subhalos,\nthe halos located within virial regions of larger halos. We argue that for\nsubhalos in dissipationless simulations, V_max,acc reflects the luminosity and\nstellar mass of the associated galaxies better than the circular velocity at\nthe epoch of observation, V_max,now.

The\nexpansion is proved to converge to the exact stress, as a consequence of the\nlocality of cascade both in scale and in space. Simple estimates show, however,\nthat the convergence rate may be slow for the expansion in spatial gradients of\nvery small scales. Therefore, we develop an approximate expansion, based upon\nan assumption that similar or `coherent' contributions to turbulent stress are\nobtained from disjoint subgrid regions. This Coherent-Subregions Approximation\n(CSA) yields an MSG expansion that can be proved to converge rapidly at all\nscales and is hopefully still reasonably accurate. As an application, we\nconsider the cascades of energy and helicity in three-dimensional turbulence.\nTo first order in velocity-gradients, the stress has three contributions: a\ntensile stress along principal directions of strain, a contractile stress along\nvortex lines, and a shear stress proportional to `skew-strain.' While\nvortex-stretching plays the major role in energy cascade, there is a second,\nless scale-local contribution from `skew-strain'. For helicity cascade the\nsituation is reversed, and it arises scale-locally from `skew-strain' while the\nstress along vortex-lines gives a secondary, less scale-local contribution.\nThese conclusions are illustrated with simple exact solutions of 3D Euler\nequations. In the first, energy cascade occurs by Taylor's mechanism of\nstretching and spin-up of small-scale vortices due to large-scale strain.

We show that\nthis conclusion extends a result of Kraichnan for spectral transfer and is due\nto absence of vortex-stretching in 2D. This `weakly local' mechanism of inverse\ncascade requires a relative rotation between the principal directions of strain\nat different scales and we argue for this using both the dynamical equations of\nmotion and also a heuristic model of `thinning' of small-scale vortices by an\nimposed large-scale strain. Carrying out our expansion to second-order in\ngradients, we find two additional terms in the stress that can contribute to\nenergy cascade. The first is a Newtonian stress with an `eddy-viscosity' due to\ndifferential strain-rotation, and the second is a tensile stress exerted along\nvorticity contour-lines. The latter was anticipated by Kraichnan for a very\nspecial model situation of small-scale vortex wave-packets in a uniform strain\nfield. We prove a proportionality in 2D between the mean rates of differential\nstrain-rotation and of vorticity-gradient stretching, analogous to a similar\nrelation of Betchov for 3D.

One of the most important questions is why the\nsystems that exert fluctuations stay long-term stable. Is there any general\nfunctional relation that provides long-term stability despite the wide\ndiversity of the fluctuations commence: emotions, economics, physical\ninteractions etc? I assert that such functional relation does exist and reveal\nits specification: the route to the long-term stability is through coherence\nand boundedness as necessary conditions. It is demonstrated that the chaoticity\nis the hallmark of that relationship. The present contribution is a systematic\nstudy written as a book on the relation between long-term stability and\nexerting macroscopic fluctuations. Further attention is focused on the\nmechanism that guarantees the boundedness and the coherence of the local\nfluctuations in the physical systems. Crucial arguments that neither of the\nexisting so far approaches to the behavior of the extended many-body systems\nprovides boundedness and coherence of the fluctuations are put forward. It\nturns out that the mechanism that brings about macroscopic fluctuations has\nuniversal properties and entangles quantum decoherence, chaos and 1/f noise in\na tricky interplay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2005 18:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

The notion of neighborhood\nhere is given by a regular network, a random network or a small world network.\nWe show that under herding behavior the cooperation between the agents is less\nefficient than that one which arises in the standard minority game.

Attention also increases the coherence between neurons\nresponding to the same stimulus (Fries et al, 2001, Science 291:1560). We\nstudied how the firing rate and synchrony of a densely interconnected cortical\nnetwork varied with contrast and how they were modulated by attention. We found\nthat an increased driving current to the excitatory neurons increased the\noverall firing rate of the network, whereas variation of the driving current to\ninhibitory neurons modulated the synchrony of the network. We explain the\nsynchrony modulation in terms of a locking phenomenon during which the ratio of\nexcitatory to inhibitory firing rates is approximately constant for a range of\ndriving current values. We explored the hypothesis that contrast is represented\nprimarily as a drive to the excitatory neurons, whereas attention corresponds\nto a reduction in driving current to the inhibitory neurons. Using this\nhypothesis, the model reproduces the following experimental observations: (1)\nthe firing rate of the excitatory neurons increases with contrast; (2) for high\ncontrast stimuli, the firing rate saturates and the network synchronizes; (3)\nattention shifts the contrast response curve to lower contrast values; (4)\nattention leads to stronger synchronization that starts at a lower value of the\ncontrast compared with the attend-away condition. In addition, it predicts that\nattention increases the delay between the inhibitory and excitatory synchronous\nvolleys produced by the network, allowing the stimulus to recruit more\ndownstream neurons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2005 16:23:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2005 23:24:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
