Our work, in combination with contemporaneous work by Cushing and\nVacca, makes it clear that the latter object is more probably a mid-M dwarf\nwith an unusual composition that gives it some sub-dwarf spectral features. We\nuse the data to derive precise radial velocities for both objects and to\nestimate space motion; both are consistent with halo kinematics. We measure the\nprojected rotational velocities, revealing very slow rotation for the old sd?M6\nobject \\lsr. \\twom exhibits rapid rotation of vsini = 65 +- 15km/s, consistent\nwith the behavior of L dwarfs. This means that the braking time for L dwarfs is\nextremely long, or that perhaps they never slow down. A detailed comparison of\nthe atomic Rb and Cs lines to spectra of field L dwarfs shows the spectral type\n\\twom is consistent with being mid- to late-L. The Rb I and K I lines of \\lsr\\\nare like an early-L dwarf, but the Cs I line is like a mid-M dwarf. The\nappearance of the Ca II triplet in absorption in this object is very hard to\nunderstand if it is not as least as warm as M6. We explain these effects in a\nconsistent way using a mildly metal-poor mid-M model. M subdwarfs have weak\nmetal-oxides and enhanced metal-hydrides relative to normal M dwarfs. \\lsr\\\nexhibits metal-hydrides like an M dwarf but metal-oxides like a subdwarf. The\nsame explanation that resolves the atomic line discrepancy explains this as\nwell.

In other words its image represents the\nbody as it was in several different times i.e. it is distorted and does not\ncorrespond to its real appearance. The useful experimental arrangement is set\nand then used to derive the general expression that transforms two-dimensional\nstationary shapes to their apparent forms, which could be photographed once\nthey are set in motion. It is then used to simulate the so-called Gamow's\nbicycle combined out of circles and straight lines. The simulation outlines two\nimportant aspects of bike's motion: apparent distance of two points and\napparent velocity which are then discussed thoroughly. It is found that the\napproaching body is elongated and its apparent speed is greater than its real\none (under certain conditions can exceed the speed of light), whereas the\nreceding one is contracted (but not in a matter of Lorentz contraction) with\nthe speed smaller than the real one. Both the apparent length and speed tends\nto a certain limit when time tends to plus or minus infinity. The change of\nboth parameters takes place in the vicinity of the nearest approach to the\nobserver and is more rapid when the velocity greater and the distance is\nsmaller. When the moving vertical rod is seen at right angle, its total\napparent length is Lorentz contracted, however its interior is still distorted.\nAt the same conditions apparent velocity of a point equals its real one.\nFinally it is proven that not only the apparent geometrical shape changes as\nthe body moves but also its color according to Doppler shift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2005 14:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
