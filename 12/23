We hope that there will be future modeling applications in\nhigh-energy particle astrophysics. We modify the dipole model of McDermott,\nFrankfurt, Guzey, and Strikman (MFGS) by fixing the cross section at the\nmaximum value allowed by the unitarity constraint whenever the dipole model\nwould otherwise predict a unitarity violation. We observe that, under\nreasonable assumptions, a significant fraction of the real photon cross section\nresults from dipole interactions where the QCD coupling constant is small, and\nthat the MFGS model is consistent with the Froissart bound. The resulting model\npredicts a rise of the cross section of about a factor of 12 when the the\nphoton energy is increased from $10^{3}$ GeV to $10^{12}$ GeV. We extend the\nanalysis to the case of scattering off a $^{12}$C target. We find that, due to\nthe low thickness of the light nuclei, unitarity for the scattering off\nindividual nucleons plays a larger role than for the scattering off the nucleus\nas a whole. At the same time the proximity to the black disk limit results in a\nsubstantial increase of the amount of nuclear shadowing. This, in turn, slows\ndown the rate of increase of the total cross section with energy as compared to\nthe proton case. As a result we find that the $^{12}$C nuclear cross section\nrises by about a factor of 7 when the photon energy is increased from $10^{3}$\nGeV to $10^{12}$ GeV.

Introducing spatial degrees of freedom\nand allowing for stochastic fluctuations generically invalidates the classical,\ndeterministic mean-field picture. Already within mean-field theory, however,\nspatial constraints, modeling locally limited resources, lead to the emergence\nof a continuous active-to-absorbing state phase transition. Field-theoretic\narguments, supported by Monte Carlo simulation results, indicate that this\ntransition, which represents an extinction threshold for the predator\npopulation, is governed by the directed percolation universality class. In the\nactive state, where predators and prey coexist, the classical center\nsingularities with associated population cycles are replaced by either nodes or\nfoci. In the vicinity of the stable nodes, the system is characterized by\nessentially stationary localized clusters of predators in a sea of prey. Near\nthe stable foci, however, the stochastic lattice Lotka-Volterra system displays\ncomplex, correlated spatio-temporal patterns of competing activity fronts.\nCorrespondingly, the population densities in our numerical simulations turn out\nto oscillate irregularly in time, with amplitudes that tend to zero in the\nthermodynamic limit.

This led to numerous quantum paradoxes which are reconsidered in\nthis paper. The development of quantum measurement theory, initiated by von\nNeumann, indicated a possibility for resolution of this interpretational crisis\nby divorcing the algebra of the dynamical generators from the algebra of the\nactual observables. It is shown that within this approach quantum causality can\nbe rehabilitated in the form of a superselection rule for compatibility of past\nobservables with the potential future. This rule, together with the\nself-compatibility of measurements insuring the consistency of histories, is\ncalled the nondemolition principle. The application of this causality condition\nin the form of the dynamical commutation relations leads to the derivation of\nthe generalized von Neumann reductions, usharp, instantaneous, spontaneous, and\neven continuous in time. This gives a quantum probabilistic solution, in the\nform of the dynamical filtering equations, of the notorious measurement problem\nwhich was tackled unsuccessfully by many famous physicists starting with\nSchroedinger and Bohr. The simplest Markovian quantum stochastic model for the\ncontinuous in time measurements involves a boundary-value problem in second\nquantization for input \"offer\" waves in one extra dimension, and a reduction of\nthe algebra of \"actual\" observables to an Abelian subalgebra for the output\nwaves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2005 22:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
