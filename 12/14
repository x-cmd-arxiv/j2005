Multiple realizations of equivalent cases (100\nsimulations per case) are used to build up a robust statistical description of\nthese systems, e.g., distributions of closest approaches, mass profiles, and\ndistributions of radial locations. These results provide a framework from which\nto assess the effects of these clusters on star and planet formation. The\ndistributions of radial positions are used in conjunction with distributions of\nFUV luminosities (also calculated here) to determine the radiation exposure of\ncircumstellar disks. The distributions of closest approaches are used in\nconjunction with scattering cross sections (calculated here from $10^5$\nscattering experiments) to determine the probability of solar system\ndisruption.

Our main\nconclusion is that clusters in this size range have only a modest effect on\nforming planetary systems: Interaction rates are low so that the typical solar\nsystem experiences a single encounter within 1000 AU. Radiation exposure is\nlow, with median FUV flux $G_0$ = 900, so that photoevaporation of disks is\nonly important beyond 30 AU.

Simulations are conducted\nusing two-body rigid ion BMHFT potentials, with full treatment of long-range\nCoulomb forces. After a preliminary check of the description of bulk NaCl\nprovided by these potentials, which seems generally good even at the melting\npoint, we carry out a new investigation of solid and liquid surfaces. Solid\nNaCl(100) is found in this model to be very anharmonic and yet exceptionally\nstable when hot. It is predicted by a thermodynamic integration calculation of\nthe surface free energy that NaCl(100) should be a well ordered, non-melting\nsurface, metastable even well above the melting point. By contrast, the\nsimulated liquid NaCl surface is found to exhibit large thermal fluctuations\nand no layering order. In spite of that, it is shown to possess a relatively\nlarge surface free energy. The latter is traced to a surface entropy deficit,\nreflecting some kind of surface short range order. Finally, the solid-liquid\ninterface free energy is derived through Young's equation from direct\nsimulation of partial wetting of NaCl(100) by a liquid droplet. It is concluded\nthat three elements, namely the exceptional anharmonic stability of the solid\n(100) surface, the molecular short range order at the liquid surface, and the\ncostly solid liquid interface, all conspire to cause the anomalously poor\nwetting of the (100) surface by its own melt in the BMHFT model of NaCl -- and\nmost likely also in real alkali halide surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2005 18:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The proposed approach is very powerful and useful. It can be used (1)\nto test if a logic program terminates for a given concrete or moded query, (2)\nto test if a logic program terminates for all concrete or moded queries, and\n(3) to find all (most general) concrete/moded queries that are most likely\nterminating (or non-terminating).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2005 07:09:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A classical and powerful approach to\ncomplexity analysis consists in formally deriving, from the program syntax, a\nset of constraints expressing bounds on the resources required by the program,\nwhich are then solved, possibly applying safe approximations. In several\ninteresting cases, these constraints take the form of recurrence relations.\nWhile techniques for solving recurrences are known and implemented in several\ncomputer algebra systems, these do not completely fulfill the needs of fully\nautomatic complexity analysis: they only deal with a somewhat restricted class\nof recurrence relations, or sometimes require user intervention, or they are\nrestricted to the computation of exact solutions that are often so complex to\nbe unmanageable, and thus useless in practice. In this paper we briefly\ndescribe PURRS, a system and software library aimed at providing all the\ncomputer algebra services needed by applications performing or exploiting the\nresults of worst-case complexity analyses. The capabilities of the system are\nillustrated by means of examples derived from the analysis of programs written\nin a domain-specific functional programming language for real-time embedded\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2005 09:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In\nthe light of several model calculations, it is found that the density matrix\ncontains information about both quantum entanglement and phase transitions even\nthough there may not be any direct relationship implied by one on the other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2005 16:43:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
