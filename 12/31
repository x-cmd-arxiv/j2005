We describe an implementation of a technique that is based on the\nshapelets formalism.\n  The shapelets technique describes PSF and observed images in terms of\nGauss-Hermite expansions (Gaussians times polynomials). It allows the various\noperations that a galaxy image undergoes before being registered in a camera\n(gravitational shear, PSF convolution, pixelation) to be modeled in a single\nformalism, so that intrinsic ellipticities can be derived in a single modeling\nstep.\n  The resulting algorithm, and tests of it on idealized data as well as more\nrealistic simulated images from the STEP project, are described. Results are\nvery promising, with attained calibration accuracy better than four percent (1\npercent for round PSFs) and PSF ellipticity correction better than a factor of\n20. Residual calibration problems are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2005 15:33:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2006 09:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The\nscheme realises the proposal of Low and Volkas to generate zero quark mixing\nand tribimaximal neutrino mixing at tree-level, with deviations from both\narising from small corrections after spontaneous A_4 breaking. In the neutrino\nsector, the breaking is A_4 --> Z_2, while in the quark and charged-lepton\nsectors it is A_4 --> Z_3 = C_3. The full theory has A_4 completely broken, but\nthe two different unbroken subgroups in the two sectors force the dominant\nmixing patterns to be as stated above.

We present here an\nexperimental investigation of the anomalous dispersion properties of\nbi-frequency Raman gain in rubidium vapor, with the goal of using this medium\nfor producing the critically anomalous dispersion condition. A heterodyne phase\nmeasurement technique is used to measure accurately the index variation\nassociated with the dispersion. The slope of the negative linear dispersion (or\ngroup index) is experimentally varied by more than two orders of magnitude\nwhile changing the frequency separation between pump fields, responsible for\nproducing gain. Using this result, we have identified the experimental\nparameters for achieving a null value of the group index, corresponding to the\ncritically anomalous dispersion condition necessary for enhanced rotational\nsensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2005 20:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
