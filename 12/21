Night to night flux variations of >0.1 mag were observed in S5 0716+714\nduring a campaign of ~2 weeks in 1996.A good correlation between the\nlightcurves in different optical bands was found for both inter-night and\nintra-night observations. Two prominent events of intra-night optical\nvariability were detected in S5 0716+714.Each of these rapidly varying segments\nof the lightcurves trace an exponential flux profile whose rate of variation is\nthe same in both cases. Our long-term monitoring data of S5 0716+714 showed a\ndistinct flare around JD 2451875 which can be identified in the BVRI bands.This\nflare coincides with the brightest phase recorded during 1994-2001 in the\nlong-term lightcurves reported by Raiteri et al.(2003). No evidence for the\nbluer when brighter trend was noticed on inter-night and intra-night time\nscales. On the other hand, our nearly simultaneous multiband observations of BL\nLacertae in October 2001 showed flux variations that were not achromatic. This\nblazar was found to become bluer when brighter on intra-night time scales and\nthere is a hint of the same trend on inter-night time scales. Based on five\nnights of observations during a week, BL Lacertae showed a peak night-to-night\nvariability of ~0.6 mag in B. Thus, we found that the present observations of\nthe two blazars, reveal a contrasting behaviour in terms of the dependence of\nspectral hardening with increasing brightness, at least on intra-night, and\npossibly also on inter-night, time scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2005 09:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These methods can\nbe extended later to the superconducting materials. In our model we assume the\nextended Hubbard Hamiltonian. Transition from the paramagnetic state to the\nordered state of magnetic nature is decided by the competition between kinetic\nand potential energy in which there is an increase in the kinetic energy\nmoderated by the inter-site interactions, and a decrease in the potential\nenergy. The competition between these two energies results in the existence of\ncritical values of interactions for creating magnetic alignment. Only when\nexisting in a given material interaction exceeds the critical value for a given\ntype of ordering we can have the alignment of this type.\n  The influence of inter-site correlation on F and AF in the presence of\nCoulomb on-site correlation is investigated. The well known Landau free energy\nexpansion is corrected for both F and AF ordering to reflect the presence of\ncritical interaction in the second order term, which leads to the magnetic\nalignment.\n  The numerical results show that the inter-site interactions favor F at the\nend of the band and AF at the half-filled point. In both cases of F and AF\nordering, these interactions lower substantially the Curie and Neel's\ntemperature towards experimental data.

Our derivation is\nbased on a generalization from flat spacetime to curved spacetime of the\nextended-body approach of Ori and Rosenthal. In this approach the charged\nparticle is first modeled as a body of finite extension s, the net force acting\non the extended body is computed, and the limit s -> 0 is taken at the end of\nthe calculation. Concretely our extended body is a dumbbell that consists of\ntwo point charges that are maintained at a constant spacelike separation s. The\nnet force acting on the dumbbell includes contributions from the mutual forces\nexerted on each charge by the field created by the other charge, the individual\nself-forces exerted on each charge by its own field, and the external force\nwhich is mostly responsible for the dumbbell's acceleration. These\ncontributions are added up, in a way that respects the curved nature of the\nspacetime, and all diverging terms in the net force are shown to be removable\nby mass renormalization.

The important classes of quantum cloning machines are\nreviewed, in particular state-independent and state-dependent cloning machines.\nThe 1-to-2 cloning problem is then studied from a formal point of view, using\nthe isomorphism between completely positive maps and operators, which leads to\nthe so-called double-Bell ansatz. This also yields an efficient numerical\napproach to quantum cloning, based on semidefinite programming methods. The\nderivation of the optimal N-to-M universal cloning machine in d dimensions is\nthen detailed, as well as the notion of asymmetric cloning machines. In the\nsecond part of this review, the optical implementation of cloning machines is\nconsidered. It is shown that the universal cloning of photons can be achieved\nby parametric amplification of light or by symmetrization via the\nHong-Ou-Mandel effect. The various experimental demonstrations of quantum\ncloning machines are reviewed. The cloning of orthogonally polarized photons is\nalso considered, as well as the asymmetric and phase-covariant cloning of\nphotons. Finally, the extension of quantum cloning to continuous variables is\nanalyzed. The optimal cloning of coherent states of light by phase-insensitive\namplification is explained, as well as the experimental realization of\ncontinuous-variable quantum cloning with linear optics, measurement, and\nfeed-forward operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2005 09:50:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-27"}

The latter hypothesis was\ndiscussed actively by Buonomano since 1980th. However, in contrast to Bell's\nhypothesis on nonlocality it did not attract so much attention. The only\nexperiment testing the hypothesis on nonergodicity was performed in neutron\ninterferometry (by Summhammer, in 1989). This experiment can be considered as\nrejecting this hypothesis.
