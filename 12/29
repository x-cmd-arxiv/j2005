The main practical challenge for the general\napplication of MCMC is the need to construct Markov chains which quickly\nconverge.

The action-at-a-distance nature of Newton's gravity requires further\nverification from Einstein's theory for its use in the large-scale nonlinear\nregimes. We study the domain of validity of the Newtonian cosmology by\ninvestigating weakly nonlinear regimes in relativistic cosmology assuming a\nzero-pressure and irrotational fluid.

Third, the correction terms are\nindependent of the horizon scale and are quite small in the large-scale near\nthe horizon. These conclusions are based on our special (and proper) choice of\nvariables and gauge conditions.

The suggested approach is based on\nthe concept of a discontinuity structure or scale Q in a topological space X.\nThis structure serves as a scale for the initial topology on X. Problems of\nscience and engineering need such a scale because all measurements and the\nmajority of computations are performed in a definite scale and problems of\nscalability are important both for physical theories and computational\nalgorithms. Taking a mapping of a topological space X with the discontinuity\nstructure Q into a topological space Y with a discontinuity structure R, we\ndefine (Q,R)-continuity, weak (Q,R)-continuity, and R-continuity of this\nmapping. Fuzzy continuous functions, which are studied in neoclassical\nanalysis, are examples of R-continuous mappings.

As announced in [Horodecki, Oppenheim,\nWinter, Nature 436, 673 (2005)], the optimal entanglement cost of this task is\nthe conditional entropy if classical communication is free. Since this quantity\ncan be negative, and the state merging rate measures partial quantum\ninformation, we find that quantum information can be negative. The classical\ncommunication rate also has a minimum rate: a certain quantum mutual\ninformation. State merging enabled one to solve a number of open problems:\ndistributed quantum data compression, quantum coding with side information at\nthe decoder and sender, multi-party entanglement of assistance, and the\ncapacity of the quantum multiple access channel. It also provides an\noperational proof of strong subadditivity.

In addition, we also consider the system under an adiabatically\ntime-varying magnetic field which is weakly coupled to the bath. An important\nfeature of this model is that it reveals existence of a temperature-scale in\nwhich adiabaticity condition is preserved and beyond which the geometric phase\nis varying quite rapidly with temperature.

In the first, we show that entropy is\nan inherent property of any system in any state, and that its analytical\nexpression must conform to eight criteria. In the second, we recognize that\nquantum thermodynamics: (i) admits quantum probabilities described either by\nwave functions or by nonstatistical density operators; and (ii) requires a\nnonlinear equation of motion that is delimited by but more general than the\nSchroedinger equation, and that accounts for both reversible and irreversible\nevolutions of the state of the system in time.
