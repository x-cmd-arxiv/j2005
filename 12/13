Not only will such measurements\nprovide a detailed view of that epoch, but, since the 21 cm emission also\ntraces the distribution of matter in the Universe, this signal can be used to\nconstrain cosmological parameters at 6 < z < 20. The sensitivity of an\ninterferometer to the cosmological information in the signal may depend on how\nprecisely the angular dependence of the 21 cm 3-D power spectrum can be\nmeasured. Utilizing an analytic model for reionization, we quantify all the\neffects that break the spherical symmetry of the 3-D 21 cm power spectrum and\nproduce physically motivated predictions for this power spectrum. We find that\nupcoming observatories will be sensitive to the 21 cm signal over a wide range\nof scales, from larger than 100 to as small as 1 comoving Mpc. We consider\nthree methods to measure cosmological parameters from the signal: (1) direct\nfitting of the density power spectrum to the signal, (2) using only the\nvelocity field fluctuations in the signal, (3) looking at the signal at large\nenough scales such that all fluctuations trace the density field. With the\nforemost method, the first generation of 21 cm observations should moderately\nimprove existing constraints on cosmological parameters for certain\nlow-redshift reionization scenarios, and a two year observation with the second\ngeneration interferometer MWA5000 can improve constraints on Omega_w, Omega_m\nh^2, Omega_b h^2, Omega_nu, n_s, and alpha_s.

The LF of the SMC, the LMC and NGC 5236 are characterized by a\npower-law behavior NdL~L^-a dL, with a mean exponent of <a> = 2.0 +/- 0.2. This\ncan be explained by a cluster population formed with a constant cluster\nformation rate, in which the maximum cluster mass per logarithmic age bin is\ndetermined by the size-of-sample effect and therefore increases with\nlog(age/yr). The LFs of NGC 6946 and M51 are better described by a double\npower-law distribution or a Schechter function. When a cluster population has a\nmass function that is truncated below the limit given by the size-of-sample\neffect, the total LF shows a bend at the magnitude of the maximum mass, with\nthe age of the oldest cluster in the population, typically a few Gyr due to\ndisruption.

For\ndistances greater than 5\" (1500 AU) from the driving source, emission from both\ntransitions follows a Hubble-law behavior, with SiO(8-7) reaching higher\nvelocities than CO(3-2), and being located upstream of the CO(3-2) knots. This\nindicates that the SiO(8-7) emission is likely tracing entrained gas very close\nto the primary jet, while the CO(3-2) is tracing less dense entrained gas. From\nthe SiO(5-4) data of Hirano et al. we find that the SiO(8-7)/SiO(5-4)\nbrightness temperature ratio along the jet decreases for knots far from the\ndriving source. This is consistent with the density decreasing along the jet,\nfrom (3-10)x10^6 cm^{-3} at 500 AU to (0.8-4)x10^6 cm^{-3} at 5000 AU from the\ndriving source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2005 18:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

With an\nepitaxial AF which has one spin axis, the cooling field orients the exchange\nfield along the spin axis.

With a twinned AF where there are two orthogonal spin\naxes, the exchange field direction is along the bisector of the spin axes that\nencompass the cooling field.

A multiplication of de Rham-Federer characters is defined\nusing transversality results for flat and rectifiable currents.

A generalized quantum stochastic\nnonadapted multiple integral is explicitly defined in Fock scale, its\ncontinuity and quantum stochastic differentiability is proved. A unified\nnon-adapted and functional quantum Ito formula is discovered and established\nboth in weak and strong sense, and the multiplication formula on the\nexponential Ito algebra is found for the relatively bounded kernel-operators in\nFock scale. The unitarity and projectivity properties of nonadapted quantum\nstochastic linear differential equations are studied, and their solution is\nconstructed for the locally bounded nonadapted generators in terms of the\nchronological products in the underlying kernel algebra canonically represented\nby triangular operators in the pseudo-Fock space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2005 12:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The analysis of the experimental data at 13.6, 45 and 221\nMeV simultaneously has been performed by Carlson \\textit{et al.}, who concluded\nto an agreement with the original DDH estimates for the PNC meson-nucleon\ncouplings. In this work, it is shown first that the comparison with updated\nhadronic predictions of these couplings rather suggests the existence of some\ndiscrepancy for the PNC $\\omega NN$ coupling. The effect of variations on the\nstrong coupling constants and introduction of cutoffs in the one-boson-exchange\nweak potential is then investigated. As expected, it turns out that the\nresulting asymmetry is quite sensitive to these parameters regardless of the\nenergy. However the above discrepancy persists. The dependence of this\nconclusion on various ingredients entering an improved description of the PNC\n$NN$ force is also examined. These include the two-pion resonance nature of the\nrho meson and some momentum dependence of the isoscalar PNC $\\rho NN$ vertex.\nIt is found that none of these corrections is able to remove or even alleviate\nthe above discrepancy.

This may be valuable for understanding the\nunderlying concepts of relativity theory. In four-dimensional spacetime\ncontinuum, the displacement field of matter motion is measurable quantities.\nBased on these measurements, a finite geometrical field can be established. On\nthis sense, the matter motion in physics is viewed as the deformation of\nspacetime continuum. Suppose the spacetime continuum is isotropic, based on the\nleast action principle, the general motion equations can be established. In\nthis part, Newton motion and special relativity are discussed. Based on the\nfinite geometrical field theory of matter motion, the Newton motion equation\nand the special relativity can be derived simply based on the isotropy of\nspacetime continuum and the definition of inertial system. This research shows\nthat the Lorentz transformation is required by both of the inertial system\ndefinition and the time gauge invariance for inertial systems. Hence, the\nspecial relativity is the logic conclusion of time invariance in inertial\nsystem. The source independent of light velocity supports the isotropy of\ninertial system rather than the concept of proper time, which not only causes\nmany paradox, such as the twin-paradox, but also causes many misunderstanding\nand controversial arguments.
