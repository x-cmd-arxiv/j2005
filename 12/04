Filaments emitting in [O III] are distributed throughout much\nof the 8 arcmin diameter shell seen in X-ray and radio images, including a few\nat the very outermost shell limits. We have also detected four small complexes\nof filaments that show [S II] emission along with [OIII]. In a single long-slit\nspectrum we find variations of almost an order of magnitude in the relative\nstrengths of oxygen and sulfur lines, which must result from abundance\nvariations. None of the filaments, with or without [S II], shows any evidence\nfor hydrogen, so all appear to be fragments of pure SN ejecta. The [S II]\nfilaments provide the first evidence for undiluted products of oxygen burning\nin the ejecta from the supernova that gave rise to G292.0+1.8. Some oxygen\nburning must have occurred, but the paucity of [S II]-emitting filaments\nsuggests that either the oxygen burning was not extensive or that most of its\nproducts have yet to be excited. Most of the outer filaments exhibit radial,\npencil-like morphologies that suggest an origin as Rayleigh-Taylor fingers of\nejecta, perhaps formed during the explosion. Simulations of core-collapse\nsupernovae predict such fingers, but these have never before been so clearly\nobserved in a young SNR. The total flux from the SNR in [OIII] 5007 is 5.4 *\n10**-12 ergs/cm**2/s. Using a distance of 6 kpc and an extinction correction\ncorresponding to E(B-V) = 0.6 (lower than previous values but more consistent\nboth with our data and radio and X-ray estimates of NH), this leads to a\nluminosity of 1.6 * 10**35 ergs/s in the 5007 Ang. line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2005 18:33:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2006 23:33:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 May 2006 13:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The\ndiscriminator is a fixed measurement that has two kinds of input registers: the\nprogram registers and the data register. The quantum state in the data register\nis what users want to identify, which is confirmed to be among the n states in\nprogram registers. The task of the discriminator is to tell the users which\nstate stored in the program registers is equivalent to that in the data\nregister. First, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for judging an\nunambiguous programmable discriminator. Then, if $m=n$, we present an optimal\nunambiguous programmable discriminator for them, in the sense of maximizing the\nworst-case probability of success. Finally, we propose a universal unambiguous\nprogrammable discriminator for arbitrary n quantum states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2005 07:17:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2006 13:58:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2006 18:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
