In this work, we\nprove that the power series converges to all orders in perturbation theory.\nSolving the RG equation at higher orders, we determine the running coupling as\nan implicit function of the 2-loop order running coupling. Then we analyze the\nsingularity structure of the higher order coupling in the complex 2-loop\ncoupling plane. This enables us to calculate the radii of convergence of the\nseries solutions at the 3- and 4-loop orders as a function of the number of\nquark flavours $n_{\\rm f}$.

The\ncorrespondence between the singularity structure of the running coupling in the\ncomplex momentum squared plane and the convergence radius of the series\nsolution is established.

In particular, they encode the locations of the proteins in the shells\nthat encapsulate, and hence provide protection for, the viral genome. Despite\nof its huge success and numerous applications in virology experimental results\nhave provided evidence for the fact that the theory is too restrictive to\ndescribe all known viruses. Especially, the family of Papovaviridae, which\ncontains cancer-causing viruses, falls out of the scope of this theory.\n  In a recent paper we have shown that certain members of the family of\nPapovaviridae can be described via tilings. In this paper, we develop a\ncomprehensive mathematical framework for the derivation of all surface\nstructures of viral particles in this family. We show that this formalism fixes\nthe structure and relative sizes of all particles collectively so that there\nexists only one scaling factor that relates the sizes of all particles with\ntheir biological counterparts.\n  The series of polyhedra derived here complements the Caspar-Klug family of\npolyhedra.

The problem turns out\nto be ill-posed since we do not know which representation of the algebra of\ncanonical commutation relations (CCR) to choose for field quantization. Once we\nmake a choice, we can solve the question of entanglement unambiguously. So the\ndifficulty is not with mathematics, but with physics of the problem. In order\nto make the discussion explicit we analyze from this perspective a popular\nargument based on a photon leaving a beam splitter and interacting with two\ntwo-level atoms. We first solve the problem algebraically in Heisenberg\npicture, without any assumption about the form of representation of CCR. Then\nwe take the $\\infty$-representation and show in two ways that in two-mode\nstates the modes are maximally entangled with vacuum, but single-mode states\nare not entangled. Next we repeat the analysis in terms of the representation\nof CCR taken from Berezin's book and show that two-mode states do not involve\nthe mode-vacuum entanglement. Finally, we switch to a family of reducible\nrepresentations of CCR recently investigated in the context of field\nquantization, and show that the entanglement with vacuum is present even for\nsingle-mode states.
