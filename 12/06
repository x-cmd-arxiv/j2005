We find that\nstructure formation in the circumstellar gas during the early main-sequence\nevolution occurs as in the 60 solar mass case but is much less pronounced\nbecause of the lower mechanical wind luminosity of the star. Since on the other\nhand the shell-like structure of the HII region is largely preserved, effects\nthat rely on this symmetry become more important. At the end of the stellar\nlifetime 1% of the energy released as Lyman continuum radiation and stellar\nwind has been transferred to the circumstellar gas. From this fraction 10% is\nkinetic energy of bulk motion, 36% is thermal energy, and the remaining 54% is\nionization energy of hydrogen. The sweeping up of the slow red supergiant wind\nby the fast Wolf-Rayet wind produces remarkable morphological structures and\nemission signatures, which are compared with existing observations of the\nWolf-Rayet bubble S308. Our model reproduces the correct order of magnitude of\nobserved X-ray luminosity, the temperature of the emitting plasma as well as\nthe limb brightening of the intensity profile. This is remarkable, because\ncurrent analytical and numerical models of Wolf-Rayet bubbles fail to\nconsistently explain these features. A key result is that almost the entire\nX-ray emission in this stage comes from the shell of red supergiant wind swept\nup by the shocked Wolf-Rayet wind rather than from the shocked Wolf-Rayet wind\nitself as hitherto assumed and modeled. This offers a possible solution to what\nis called the ``missing wind problem'' of Wolf-Rayet bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2005 16:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The spectrum shows a clear damping wing at wavelengths\nredward of the Lyman break, and the wing shape can be fit either by a damped Ly\nalpha system with a column density of log (N_HI/cm^{-2}) ~ 21.6 at a redshift\nclose to the detected metal absorption lines (z_metal = 6.295), or by almost\nneutral IGM extending to a slightly higher redshift of z_{IGM,u} ~ 6.36.

Mathematically, such metrics indicate spacetime behaves locally like a\nsimple harmonic oscillator. In the cosmological model presented here these\nsmall spacetime oscillations compress vacuum energy into a standing wave inside\na dynamic Casimir cavity. At peak compression a phase shift occurs and the\nstanding wave forms into a particle having relativistic mass-energy equal to\nthe compressive work required to produce it. At this point the newly formed\nparticle does isobaric work to expand the volume against the external pressure\ngiven T_ii. Equilibrium is achieved when the collision rate on the volume's\ninternal and external surfaces equalizes. By treating spacetime as a classical\nthermodynamic problem and oscillator, such quantities as the mass of the\ncompressed particle--that of an axion, the radii of the initial and final\nvolume of compression, and the angular frequency of compression can be\ndetermined. During axion collision the photon frequency of the particle is\ncalculated to be in the microwave range and inversely equal to that of the\nfrequency of the spacetime compression that produced the particle. This\nsuggests axion production is a source for the 2.7K cosmic background radiation\nand dark matter that pervades spacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2005 19:44:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2005 20:09:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2005 17:35:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2005 00:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2006 17:56:15 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2006 19:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In three dimensions, and under certain conditions, they are\nclassified by modular categories. These are special kinds of categories in\nwhich topological notions such as braidings and twists play a prominent role.\nThere is a powerful graphical calculus available for working in such\ncategories, which may be regarded as a generalization of the Feynman diagrams\nmethod familiar in physics.

Important\nexamples of these types of decompositions include the Furstenberg structure\ntheorem and the Szemer\\'edi regularity lemma. One recent application of this\ndichotomy is the result of Green and Tao establishing that the prime numbers\ncontain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions (despite having density zero\nin the integers). The power of this dichotomy is evidenced by the fact that the\nGreen-Tao theorem requires surprisingly little technology from analytic number\ntheory, relying instead almost exclusively on manifestations of this dichotomy\nsuch as Szemer\\'edi's theorem. In this paper we survey various manifestations\nof this dichotomy in combinatorics, harmonic analysis, ergodic theory, and\nnumber theory. As we hope to emphasize here, the underlying themes in these\narguments are remarkably similar even though the contexts are radically\ndifferent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2005 01:54:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2005 12:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The $R$-matrix theory is used to treat the asymptotic\nbehaviour of scattering wave functions. The formalism is developed for neutral\nas well as for charged systems. We point out some specificities of continuum\nstates in the hyperspherical method. The collision matrix can be determined\nwith a good accuracy by using propagation techniques. The method is applied to\nthe $^6$He (=$\\alpha$+n+n) and $^6$Be (=$\\alpha$+p+p) systems, as well as to\n$^{14}$Be (=$^{12}$Be+n+n). For $^6$He, we essentially recover results of the\nliterature. Application to $^{14}$Be suggests the existence of an excited $2^+$\nstate below threshold. The calculated B(E2) value should make this state\nobservable with Coulomb excitation experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2005 06:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Thus it is argued that using\nrest common clocks or the equivalent the measured velocity of light emitted by\na moving source, which is quasi-velocity of foreign light, is dependent of the\nsource velocity. Nevertheless, the velocity of foreign light that should be\nmeasured by using tau-clocks is independent of the source velocity.

Recent developments in\ntheory and experiment are highlighted. In particular, atom-surface interactions\ndefine physical limits for miniaturization and coherent operation. This implies\nconstraints for applications in quantum information processing or matter wave\ninterferometry. We focus on atom-surface interaction potentials induced by\nvacuum fluctuations (Van der Waals and Casimir-Polder forces), and on\ntransitions between atomic quantum states that are induced by thermally excited\nmagnetic near fields.

Non-Abelian holonomies\nare usually associated with cyclic changes of quantum systems, but here we\nconsider a generalization to noncyclic evolutions. We argue that this open-path\nholonomy can be used to construct quantum gates. We also show that a structure\nof partially defined holonomies emerges from the open-path holonomy.
