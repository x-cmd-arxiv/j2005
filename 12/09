We compare absorption systems detected in low and/or\nhigh ionization gas and find the following: 1) All but 1 of the 10 weak low\nionization systems have a related high ionization phase. In 3 cases the high\nionization gas has only a single component, kinematically centered on the low\nionization absorption, and in the other 6 cases there are additional high\nionization components offset in velocity. The system, toward quasar 3C 273, do\nnot have a high ionization cloud; 2) There are just 6 systems with only a high\nionization phase as compared to the 9 systems with both low and high ionization\nphases; 3) The high ionization absorption in weak low ionization systems is, on\naverage, stronger than in systems with only high ionization absorption; 4) The\nkinematic structure of the high ionization in weak low ionization systems is\nsimilar to that in high ionization only systems. We find that filamentary and\nsheetlike geometries are favored, due to the relatively small observed\ncross-section of high ionization only systems. Although low ionization\nabsorbers are not closely associated with luminous galaxies, they arise in\ntheir immediate environments within the cosmic web.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2005 23:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We calculate the masses, sizes\nand average densities of the clumps as a function of the fractal dimension\n(D_f) and the fraction of the total mass in the form of clumps (epsilon). In\ngeneral, clump mass does not fulfill a simple power law with size of the type\nM_cl ~ (R_cl)**(gamma), instead the power changes, from gamma ~ 3 at small\nsizes to gamma<3 at larger sizes. The number of clumps per logarithmic mass\ninterval can be fitted to a power law N_cl ~ (M_cl)**(-alpha_M) in the range of\nrelatively large masses, and the corresponding size distribution is N_cl ~\n(R_cl)**(-alpha_R) at large sizes.

In the antiadiabatic regime, accounting on the\nsame footing for a finite phonon frequency and a finite electron bandwidth\nallows to address the evolution of the optical absorption away from the\nwell-understood molecular limit. It is shown that the width of the multiphonon\npeaks in the optical spectra depends on the temperature and on the frequency in\na way that contradicts the commonly accepted results, most notably in the\nstrong coupling case. In the adiabatic regime, on the other hand, the present\nmethod allows to identify a wide range of parameters of experimental interest,\nwhere the electron bandwidth is comparable or larger than the broadening of the\nFranck-Condon line, leading to a strong modification of both the position and\nthe shape of the polaronic absorption.

For a certain amount of the\nallocated mass/charge, the solutions have singularities of a type which could\nrender them physically unacceptable, since the corresponding physically\nrelevant quantities are singular as well. These solutions, with a number of\nzero-nodes in the metric tensor, are regularized through the $\\delta$-shell\nformalism, thus redefining the mass/charge distributions. The bifurcating\nbehaviour of regular solutions found before is no longer present in these\nsingular solutions, but quantized-like behaviour in the total mass is observed.\nSpectrum of regularized solutions restores the equality of the\nTolman--Whittaker and ADM mass, as well the equality of the net charge and ADM\nmass, which is the distinctive feature of Majumdar--Papapetrou systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2005 19:50:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2007 07:12:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}

Its form, as well as a measure in Schrodinger scalar\nproduct, depends on a gauge condition (a chosen reference frame). It is known\nthat the geometry of an appropriate Hilbert space is determined by introducing\nthe scalar product, so the Hilbert space structure turns out to be in a large\ndegree depending on a chosen gauge condition. In the present work we analyse\nthis issue from the viewpoint of the path integral approach. We consider how\nthe gauge condition changes as a result of gauge transformations. In this\nrespect, three kinds of gauge transformations can be singled out: Firstly,\nthere are residual gauge transformations, which do not change the gauge\ncondition. The second kind is the transformations whose parameters can be\nrelated by homotopy. Then the change of gauge condition could be described by\nsmoothly changing function. In particular, in this context time dependent\ngauges could be discussed. We also suggest that this kind of gauge\ntransformations leads to a smooth changing of solutions to the Schrodinger\nequation. The third kind of the transformations includes those whose parameters\nbelong to different homotopy classes. They are of the most interest from the\nviewpoint of changing the Hilbert space structure. In this case the gauge\ncondition and the very form of the Schrodinger equation would change in\ndiscrete steps when we pass from a spacetime region with one gauge condition to\nanother region with another gauge condition. In conclusion we discuss the\nrelation between quantum gravity and fundamental problems of ordinary quantum\nmechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2005 11:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We start from an exact expression for the FPT density in terms of an\ninfinite series of integrals over joint densities of level crossings, and\nconsider different approximations based on truncation or on approximate\nsummation of this series. Thus, the first few terms of the series give good\napproximations for the FPT density on short times. For rapidly decaying\ncorrelations the decoupling approximations perform well in the whole time\ndomain.\n  As an example we consider resonate-and-fire neurons representing stochastic\nunderdamped or moderately damped harmonic oscillators driven by white Gaussian\nor by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. We show, that approximations reproduce all\nqualitatively different structures of the FPT densities: from monomodal to\nmultimodal densities with decaying peaks. The approximations work for the\nsystems of whatever dimension and are especially effective for the processes\nwith narrow spectral density, exactly when markovian approximations fail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2005 12:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
