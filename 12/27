The stars and ionized gas in its disk\nare kinematically decoupled, demonstrating that pressure stripping must be\nimportant, and that tidal disruption is not the only mechanism at work.\nComparison of the gas properties seen in the X-ray and optical data on the\nplume highlight significant features of the history of stripped gas in the\nintracluster medium. The nucleus of C153 also hosts an AGN, shown by the weak\nand distorted extended radio emission and a radio compact core. The unusual\nstrength of the stripping signatures in this instance is likely related to the\nhigh relative velocity of the galaxy with respect to the intracluster medium,\nduring a cluster/cluster merger, and its passage very near the core of the\ncluster.

Particles move on curved spacetime along straight lines\n(geodesics). In the last year, I proposed the mirrored version of EGR, the\nflat-spacetime general relativity (FGR), in which particles move along curved\nlines on flat spacetime. This puts gravitational study back to the traditional\nLagrangian formulation. In fact, all claimed accurate verification of general\nrelativity is the verification of FGR, because people when confronting GR to\nobservational data, calculate time, distance, or angle by directly using the\ncoordinates in Schwarzschild solution or in post Newtonian formulation. For\nexample, people calculate the angles by directly using the coordinate $\\phi$.\nHowever, only when spacetime is flat does there exists one coordinate system\nwhich has direct meaning of time, distance, angle, and vice verse. This is the\nfamous Riemann theorem. Therefore, the more claims are made that classical\ntests of general relativity fit data with great accuracy, the more falsified is\nthe curved-spacetime assumption. People made three such specious claims to EGR\nas collected in the present paper. However, FGR predicts observationally\nverified results consistently for solar system, galaxies, and the universe on\nthe whole.

A concrete\nmodel of the modified coupling constant is proposed and it is shown, that the\nQCD corrections to the static interquark potential evaluated with this coupling\nconstant are indeed much less sensitive to the scheme parameters.

However, we show that for the important special case when\n|\\psi> represents discrete values of some real, continuous function \\psi(x),\nefficient preparation is possible by applying the eigenvalue estimation\nalgorithm to a Hamiltonian which has \\psi(x) as an eigenstate. We construct the\nrequired Hamiltonian explicitly and present an iterative algorithm for removing\nunwanted superpositions from the output state in order to reach |\\psi> within\nexponential accuracy. The method works under very general conditions and can be\nused to provide the quantum simulation algorithm with very accurate and general\nstarting states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2005 10:18:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
