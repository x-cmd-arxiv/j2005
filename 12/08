Central to this technique is to make decomposition both of fields and\noperators within the framework of multi-resolution analysis (MRA), and realize\ntheirs discrete representations. Accordingly, a homogenous point process could\nbe equivalently described by a operation of a Toeplitz matrix on a vector,\nwhich is accomplished by making use of fast Fourier transformation. The\nalgorithm could be applied widely in the cosmic statistics to tackle large data\nsets. Especially, we demonstrate this novel technique using the spherical,\ncubic and cylinder counts in cells respectively. The numerical test shows that\nthe algorithm produces an excellent agreement with the expected results.\nMoreover, the algorithm introduces naturally a sharp-filter, which is capable\nof suppressing shot noise in weak signals. In the numerical procedures, the\nalgorithm is somewhat similar to particle-mesh (PM) methods in N-body\nsimulations. As scaled with $O(N\\log N)$, it is significantly faster than the\ncurrent particle-based methods, and its computational cost does not relies on\nshape or size of sampling cells. In addition, based on this technique, we\npropose further a simple fast scheme to compute the second statistics for\ncosmic density fields and justify it using simulation samples. Hopefully, the\ntechnique developed here allows us to make a comprehensive study of\nnon-Guassianity of the cosmic fields in high precision cosmology.

Indeed we show that this simple model for\nthe EoS can produce a large variety of qualitatively different dynamical\nbehaviors that we classify using dynamical systems theory. An almost universal\nfeature is that accelerated expansion phases are mostly natural for these\nnon-linear EoS's. These are often asymptotically de Sitter thanks to the\nappearance of an effective cosmological constant. Other interesting\npossibilities that arise from the quadratic EoS are closed models that can\noscillate with no singularity, models that bounce between infinite\ncontraction/expansion and models which evolve from a phantom phase,\nasymptotically approaching a de Sitter phase instead of evolving to a \"Big\nRip\". In a second paper we investigate the effects of the quadratic EoS in\ninhomogeneous and anisotropic models, focusing in particular on singularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2005 15:49:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Based on the systematic analysis of electronic structures,\ncharge densities, Fermi surfaces, and susceptibilities of Se, Te, and Po, we\nhave proved that the stable crystal structure in VIA elements is determined by\nthe competition between the SO splitting and the crystal field splitting\ninduced by the low-symmetry structural transition. The trigonal structure is\nstabilized in Se and Te by the larger crystal field splitting than the SO\nsplitting, whereas in Po the SC structure is stabilized by the large SO\nsplitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2005 08:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

All other\njoint strategies are considered impossible; the only issue is what equilibrium\nconcept is \"correct\". This hypothesis violates the desiderata underlying\nprobability theory. Indeed, probability theory renders moot the problem of what\nequilibrium concept is correct - every joint strategy can arise with non-zero\nprobability. Rather than a first-principles derivation of an equilibrium\nconcept, game theory requires a first-principles derivation of a distribution\nover joint (mixed) strategies. This paper shows how information theory can\nprovide such a distribution over joint strategies. If a scientist external to\nthe game wants to distill such a distribution to a point prediction, that\nprediction should be set by decision theory, using their (!) loss function. So\nthe predicted joint strategy - the \"equilibrium concept\" - varies with the\nexternal scientist's loss function.

The role of mesoscopic\ndegrees of freedom with long correlation times (local degrees of freedom such\nas nuclear spins and charge traps) in qubit-related dephasing is discussed in\nterms of a quasi-static bath. A mathemat- ical framework simultaneously\ndescribing coupling to the slow mesoscopic bath and a Markovian environment is\ndeveloped and the dephasing and decoherence properties of the total system are\ninvestigated. The model is applied to several specific examples with direct\nrelevance to current ex- periments. Comparisons to experiments suggests that\nsuch quasi-static degrees of freedom play an important role in current qubit\nimplementations.
