The emphasis is on\ncomparison of films with Gaussian, exponential, and power-law long-range\nbehavior of the correlation function of surface, thickness, or bulk\nfluctuations. For small-size inhomogeneities, the mode coupling is the same for\ninhomogeneities of all types and the transport coefficients behave in the same\nway. The mode coupling becomes extremely sensitive to the correlators for\nlarge-size inhomogeneities leading to the drastically distinct behavior of the\ntransport coefficients. In high-quality films there is a noticeable difference\nbetween the QSE patterns for films with bulk and surface inhomogeneities which\nexplains why the recently predicted new type of QSE with large oscillations of\nthe transport coefficients can be observed mostly in films with surface-driven\nrelaxation. In such films with surface-dominated scattering the higher modes\ncontribute to the transport only as a result of opening of the corresponding\nmode coupling channels and appear one by one. Mode coupling also explains a\nmuch higher transport contribution from the higher modes than it is commonly\nbelieved. Possible correlations between the inhomogeneities from the opposite\nwalls provide, because of their oscillating response to the mode quantum\nnumbers, a unique insight into the mode coupling. The presence of\ninhomogeneities of several sizes leads not to a mechanical mixture of QSE\npatterns, but to the overall shifting and smoothing of the oscillations. The\nresults can lead to new, non-destructive ways of analysis of the buried\ninterfaces and to study of inhomogeneities on the scales which are inaccessible\nfor scanning techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2005 19:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
