Under the traditional assumption that the visible waveband was above\nthe peak synchrotron frequency and below the cooling frequency, the optical\nphotometry from 0.03 to 5.03 days show an afterglow decay corresponding to an\nelectron energy index of p_lc = 2.05 +/- 0.04, without a jet break as suggested\nby others.

The optical-NIR\nbroadband spectrum is also consistent with p = 2.05, but prefers A_V = 0.57\nmag. The X-ray afterglow shows a break at 1.26 x 10^4 sec, which may be the\nresult of a refreshed shock.

For p >= 0.494, where the network exhibits small-world character, the\ncritical behavior radically changes: We find a highly unusual phase transition,\nnamely an inverted Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless singularity, between a\nlow-temperature phase with non-zero magnetization and finite correlation length\nand a high-temperature phase with zero magnetization and infinite correlation\nlength. Approaching T_c from below, the magnetization and the susceptibility\nrespectively exhibit the singularities of exp(-C/sqrt(T_c-T)) and\nexp(D/sqrt(T_c-T)), with C and D positive constants. With long-range bond\nstrengths decaying with distance, we see a phase transition with power-law\ncritical singularities for all p, an unusually narrow critical region and\nimportant corrections to power-law behavior that depend on the exponent\ncharacterizing the decay of long-range interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2005 01:39:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2006 18:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In addition to\nthe Hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints, an extra first class constraint\nis introduced to generate conformal transformations.

At the triad level, the phase space of GR is further enlarged by\nincorporating spin-gauge as well as conformal symmetries.

Spinors, living in d(=1+13)-dimensional space, carry in this\napproach only the spin and interact with only the gravity through vielbeins and\ntwo kinds of the spin connection fields - the gauge fields of the Poincare\ngroup and the second kind of the Clifford algebra objects. All the quarks and\nthe leptons of one family appear in one Weyl representation of a chosen\nhandedness of the Lorentz group, if analyzed with respect to the Standard model\ngauge groups: the right handed (with respect to SO(1,3)) weak chargeless quarks\nand leptons and the left handed weak charged quark and leptons. A part of the\nstarting Lagrange density of a Weyl spinor in d=1+13 transforms right handed\nquarks and leptons into left handed quarks and leptons manifesting as the\nYukawa couplings of the Standard model. The second kind of Clifford algebra\nobjects generates families and contributes to diagonal and off diagonal Yukawa\ncouplings. The approach predicts an even number of families, treating leptons\nand quarks equivalently. In this paper we investigate within this approach the\nappearance of the Yukawa couplings within one family of quarks and leptons as\nwell as among the families (without assuming any Higgs fields).

The original calculation lead to\nthe conclusion that about the 90% of the black hole mass is radiated away in\nthe form of photons, neutrinos and light leptons, mainly electrons and muons.\nWith the advent of String Theory, such a scenario must be updated by including\nnew effects coming from the stringy nature of particles and interactions.By\ntaking for granted that black holes can be produced in hadronic collisions,\nthen their decay must take into account that: (i) we live in a D3-Brane\nembedded into an higher dimensional bulk spacetime; (ii) fundamental\ninteractions, including gravity, are unified at TeV energy scale. Thus, the\nformal description of the Hawking radiation mechanism has to be extended to the\ncase of more than four spacetime dimensions and include the presence of\nD-branes. Furthermore, unification of fundamental interactions at an energy\nscale many order of magnitude lower than the Planck energy implies that any\nkind of fundamental particle, not only leptons, is expected to be emitted. A\ndetailed understanding of the new scenario is instrumental for optimal tuning\nof detectors at future colliders, where, hopefully, this exciting new physics\nwill be tested. In this article we review higher dimensional black hole decay,\nconsidering not only the emission of particles according to Hawking mechanism,\nbut also their near horizon QED/QCD interactions.

The systems we\nconsider consist of finite particles which are killed or produced at certain\nrates, while particles in the system move on the Polish space interacting with\none another (i.e. diffusion). Thus, the corresponding Dirichlet form, which we\ncall reaction-diffusion Dirichlet form, consists of two parts: the diffusion\npart induced by certain Markov processes on the product spaces $E^n (n \\geq 1)$\nwhich determine the motion of particles, and the reaction part induced by a\n$Q$-process on $\\mathbb Z_+$ and a sequence of reference probability measures,\nwhere the $Q$-process determines the variation of the number of particles and\nthe reference measures describe the locations of newly produced particles.

To address this issue, the\nprobability of forming lethal damage by single proton tracks, derived from\npublished survival data for Chinese hamster V79 cells irradiated by protons\nwith energies from 0.57 to 5.01 MeV, has been compared to estimated yields of\nclustered DNA lesions and repair outcomes calculated with Monte Carlo models.\nThe reported studies provide new information about the potential relationship\nbetween the induction and repair of clustered DNA damage and trends in the\nexpected number of lethal events for protons with increasing linear energy\ntransfer (LET). A good correlation was found between the number of lethal\nevents in V79 cells and the induction of double-strand breaks (DSBs) consisting\nof 3 or more elementary DNA lesions. For the yields of other types of DNA\ndamage, as well as point mutations formed through the misrepair of base damage\nand single-strand breaks, observed trends with increasing LET are not\nconsistent with trends in the yields of lethal events. This observation\nsuggests that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of protons of varying\nquality may be more closely related to the induction of complex DSBs rather\nthan other forms of damage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2005 11:13:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2006 10:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

The transport properties\ndepend primarily on the maximal number, $N$, of motor molecules that may pull\nsimultaneously on the cargo particle. Since each motor must unbind from the\nfilament after a finite number of steps but can also rebind to it again, the\nactual number of pulling motors is not constant but varies with time between\nzero and $N$. An increase in the maximal number $N$ leads to a strong increase\nof the average walking distance (or run length) of the cargo particle. If the\ncargo is pulled by up to $N$ kinesin motors, e.g., the walking distance is\nestimated to be $5^{N-1}/N$ micrometers which implies that seven or eight\nkinesin molecules are sufficient to attain an average walking distance in the\ncentimeter range. If the cargo particle is pulled against an external load\nforce, this force is shared between the motors which provides a nontrivial\nmotor-motor coupling and a generic mechanism for nonlinear force-velocity\nrelationships. With increasing load force, the probability distribution of the\ninstantenous velocity is shifted towards smaller values, becomes broader, and\ndevelops several peaks. Our theory is consistent with available experimental\ndata and makes quantitative predictions that are accessible to systematic in\nvitro experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2005 15:25:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
