Excluding the statistical fluctuation effect, a proportion of ~17% of the\nshort GRBs have a negative spectral lag, i.e., the hard photons being lag\nbehind the soft photons.

Existence and stability regions for gap solitons (GSs) supported\nby the interplay of the inter-species repulsion and periodic potential are\nidentified. Two-component GSs are constructed by means of the variational\napproximation (VA) and in a numerical form. The VA provides accurate\ndescription for the GS which is a bound state of two tightly-bound components,\neach essentially trapped in one cell of the periodic potential. GSs of this\ntype dominate in the case of intra-gap solitons, with both components belonging\nto the first finite bandgap of the linear spectrum. Inter-gap solitons, with\none component residing in the second bandgap, and intra-gap solitons which have\nboth components in the second gap, are possible in a deeper periodic potential,\nwith the strength essentially exceeding the recoil energy of the atoms.\nInter-gap solitons are, typically, bound states of one tightly- and one\nloosely-bound components.
