For Hg$^+$, the configuration is $5d^9\n6s^2$. For the other ions, the configuration consists of a single $d$-electron\noutside a set of closed shells. Current interest in the quadrupole moments of\nthese states is due to the fact that optical transitions of these ions may be\nuseful as references for frequency standards. Energy shifts of the metastable\nstates due to the interactions of the quadrupole moments with external electric\nfield gradients are among the largest sources of error in these frequency\nstandards.
