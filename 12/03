The users\nare assumed to be selfish, rational, and limited by average power constraints.\nWe show that the sum-rate optimal point on the boundary of the multipleaccess\nchannel capacity region is the unique Nash Equilibrium of the corresponding\nwater-filling game. This result sheds a new light on the opportunistic\ncommunication principle and argues for the fairness of the sum-rate optimal\npoint, at least from a game theoretic perspective. The base-station is then\nintroduced as a player interested in maximizing a weighted sum of the\nindividual rates. We propose a Stackelberg formulation in which the\nbase-station is the designated game leader. In this set-up, the base-station\nannounces first its strategy defined as the decoding order of the different\nusers, in the successive cancellation receiver, as a function of the channel\nstate. In the second stage, the users compete conditioned on this particular\ndecoding strategy. We show that this formulation allows for achieving all the\ncorner points of the capacity region, in addition to the sum-rate optimal\npoint. On the negative side, we prove the non-existence of a base-station\nstrategy in this formulation that achieves the rest of the boundary points. To\novercome this limitation, we present a repeated game approach which achieves\nthe capacity region of the fading multiple access channel.

Power control is modeled as a non-cooperative game in\nwhich each user decides how much power to transmit over each carrier to\nmaximize its own utility. The utility function considered here measures the\nnumber of reliable bits transmitted over all the carriers per Joule of energy\nconsumed and is particularly suitable for networks where energy efficiency is\nimportant. The multi-dimensional nature of users' strategies and the\nnon-quasiconcavity of the utility function make the multi-carrier problem much\nmore challenging than the single-carrier or throughput-based-utility case. It\nis shown that, for all linear receivers including the matched filter, the\ndecorrelator, and the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) detector, a user's\nutility is maximized when the user transmits only on its \"best\" carrier. This\nis the carrier that requires the least amount of power to achieve a particular\ntarget signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of the\nreceiver. The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for the proposed\npower control game are studied. In particular, conditions are given that must\nbe satisfied by the channel gains for a Nash equilibrium to exist, and the\ndistribution of the users among the carriers at equilibrium is also\ncharacterized. In addition, an iterative and distributed algorithm for reaching\nthe equilibrium (when it exists) is presented.

Recent observations of\nLi6 in halo stars suggest a pre--galactic origin of this isotope, which is\nexceedingly difficult to explain by putative high redshift cosmic ray\npopulations. We investigate if one or both of these lithium problems may be\nsolved by late decaying relic particles in the Constrained Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) coupled to gravity. Assuming that the\ngravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) we find that in large\nparts of the CMSSM parameter space either of these problems can be potentially\nsolved. In particular, we also find solutions where both lithium problems may\nbe solved simultaneously. These entail the hadronic decay of relic 1 TeV staus\ninto 100 GeV gravitinos at 1000 sec after the Big Bang, as proposed by one of\nus before. Moreover, the produced gravitinos naturally contribute a large\nfraction, or all, to the by WMAP required dark matter density.

Parametric alignment\nresolves the issue of robustness to changes in parameters by finding all\noptimal alignments for all possible parameters in a PHMM. Our alignment draws\non existing heuristics for dividing whole genomes into small pieces for\nalignment, and it relies on advances we have made in computing convex polytopes\nthat allow us to parametrically align non-coding regions using biologically\nrealistic models. We demonstrate the utility of our parametric alignment for\nbiological inference by showing that cis-regulatory elements are more conserved\nbetween Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura than previously\nthought. We also show how whole genome parametric alignment can be used to\nquantitatively assess the dependence of branch length estimates on alignment\nparameters.\n  The alignment polytopes, software, and supplementary material can be\ndownloaded at http://bio.math.berkeley.edu/parametric/.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2005 21:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Where before tree shape statistics were chosen by their\nability to distinguish between macroevolutionary models, the ``resolution''\npresented in this paper quantifies the ability of a statistic to differentiate\nbetween similar and different trees. We term this a ``geometric'' approach to\ndifferentiate it from the model-based approach previously explored. A distinct\nadvantage of this perspective is that it allows evaluation of multiple tree\nshape statistics describing different aspects of tree shape. After developing\nthe methodology, it is applied here to make specific recommendations for a\nsuite of three statistics which will hopefully prove useful in applications.\nThe article ends with an application of the tree shape statistics to clarify\nthe impact of omission of taxa on tree shape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2005 01:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

An obvious\ncandidate is the spectrum of eigenvalues (or, equivalently, the characteristic\npolynomial). We show for any of these choices of matrix that the fraction of\nbinary trees with a unique spectrum goes to zero as the number of leaves goes\nto infinity. We investigate the rate of convergence of the above fraction to\nzero using numerical methods. For the adjacency and Laplacian matrices, we show\nthat that the {\\em a priori} more informative immanantal polynomials have no\ngreater power to distinguish between trees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2005 01:52:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2006 22:43:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2006 18:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
