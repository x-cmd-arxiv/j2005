It is emphasized that our model is\nentirely natural to describe the dynamics of an axially symmetric galaxy and\nthat our solution, albeit idealized, contains the essence of the problem. The\ndiscontinuity of the metric derivative on the symmetry plane is necessarily\ninterpreted as the effect of the mathematically idealized discontinuity of the\ngradient of the density and is shown to be naturally connected to the\ndistributed volume density via the Gauss divergence theorem. We present\narguments to the effect that for our approximate weak field model, we can\nchoose the physically satisfactory mass distribution without an accompanying\nsingular mass surface layer. To support this contention, we modify our solution\nslightly by removing the discontinuity with a region of continuous density\ngradient overlapping the $z=0$ plane. The alternative of invoking a surface\nlayer leads to the presence of a negative mass surface layer approaching the\nnumerical value of the positive mass continuous region. This is in\ncontradiction with the assumed stationarity of the model. We find that a test\nparticle behaves normally as it approaches the $z=0$ plane, the acceleration\nbeing towards the direction of this plane.

Of late there has been considerable interest\nin developing electronic devices based on the transport of spin, which offer\npotential advantages in dissipation, size, and speed over charge-based devices.\nHowever, these advantages bring with them additional complexity. Because each\nelectron carries a single, fixed value (-e) of charge, the electrical current\ncarried by a gas of electrons is simply proportional to its total momentum. A\nfundamental consequence is that the charge current is not affected by\ninteractions that conserve total momentum, notably collisions among the\nelectrons themselves. In contrast, the electron's spin along a given spatial\ndirection can take on two values, \"up\" and \"down\", so that the spin current and\nmomentum need not be proportional. Although the transport of spin polarization\nis not protected by momentum conservation, it has been widely assumed that,\nlike the charge current, spin current is unaffected by electron-electron (e-e)\ninteractions. Here we demonstrate experimentally not only that this assumption\nis invalid, but that over a broad range of temperature and electron density,\nthe flow of spin polarization in a two-dimensional gas of electrons is\ncontrolled by the rate of e-e collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2005 22:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This\ncriterion allows one to discriminate between the situation where a coarsening\nprocess takes place and the one where the wavelength is fixed in the course of\ntime. An intermediate scenario may occur, namely `interrupted coarsening'. The\npower of the criterion lies in the fact that the statement about the occurrence\nof coarsening, or selection of a length scale, can be made by only inspecting\nthe behavior of the branch of steady state periodic solutions. The criterion\nstates that coarsening occurs if lambda'(A)>0 while a length scale selection\nprevails if lambda'(A)<0, where $lambda$ is the wavelength of the pattern and A\nis the amplitude of the profile. This criterion is established thanks to the\nanalysis of the phase diffusion equation of the pattern. We connect the phase\ndiffusion coefficient D(lambda) (which carries a kinetic information) to\nlambda'(A), which refers to a pure steady state property. The relationship\nbetween kinetics and the behavior of the branch of steady state solutions is\nestablished fully analytically for several classes of equations. Another\nimportant and new result which emerges here is that the exploitation of the\nphase diffusion coefficient enables us to determine in a rather straightforward\nmanner the dynamical coarsening exponent. Our calculation, based on the idea\nthat |D(lambda)|=lambda^2/t, is exemplified on several nonlinear equations,\nshowing that the exact exponent is captured.

Due to the strong electromagnetic fields needed to reach any\nnoticeable effect, photon-photon scattering has not yet been observed\nexperimentally, but recent improvements in laser technology have increased the\npossibility of direct detection. A verification of the phenomena would be of\ngreat scientific value as a confirmation of quantum electrodynamics.

In order that this vacuum be\nsupersymmetric, it is well known that all field expectation values must be\nalong so-called flat directions, leaving the F- and D-terms of the scalar\npotential to be zero. The situation becomes particularly interesting when one\nattempts to realize such directions while assigning VEVS to fields transforming\nunder non-Abelian representations of the gauge group. Since the expectation\nvalue is now shared among multiple components of a field, satisfaction of\nflatness becomes an inherently geometrical problem in the group space.\nFurthermore, the possibility emerges that a single seemingly dangerous F-term\nmight experience a self-cancellation among its components.

In a (genetically)\nuniform population a typically very small subpopulation becomes metabolically\ninactive whereas the majority subpopulation remains active and grows. Bacteria\nsuch as E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA-superbug), Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [1-3] show persistence. It can render\nbacteria less vulnerable in adverse environments [1, 4, 5] and their effective\neradication through medication more difficult [2, 3, 6]. Here we show that\nmedication treatment regimes may have to be modified when persistence is taken\ninto account and characterize optimal approaches assuming that the total\nmedication dose is constrained. The determining factors are cumulative\ntoxicity, eradication power of the medication and bacterial response\ntimescales. Persistent organisms have to be fought using tailored eradication\nstrategies which display two fundamental characteristics. Ideally, the\ntreatment time should be significantly longer than in the case of persistence\nwith the medication uniformly spread out over time; however, if treatment time\nhas to be limited, then the application of medication has to be concentrated\ntowards the beginning and end of the treatment. These findings deviate from\ncurrent clinical practice, and may therefore help to optimize and simplify\ntreatments. Our use of multi-objective optimization [7] to map out the optimal\nstrategies can be generalized to other related problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2005 22:25:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2010 17:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-13"}
