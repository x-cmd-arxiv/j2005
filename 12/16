The high-z\nsurveys are more useful for cosmology than low-z ones owing to much weaker\nnon-linearities in matter clustering, redshift-space distortion and galaxy\nbias. We can then utilize the two-dimensional information of the linear power\nspectrum in angular and redshift space to measure the scale-dependent\nsuppression of matter clustering due to neutrino free-streaming as well as the\nshape of the primordial power spectrum. To illustrate capabilities of high-z\nsurveys for constraining neutrino masses and the primordial power spectrum, we\ncompare three future redshift surveys covering 300 square degrees at 0.5<z<2,\n2<z<4, and 3.5<z<6.5. We find that, combined with the cosmic microwave\nbackground data expected from the Planck satellite, these surveys allow\nprecision determination of the total neutrino mass with the projected errors of\nsigma(m_nu)=0.059, 0.043, and 0.025 eV, respectively, thus yielding a positive\ndetection of the neutrino mass rather than an upper limit, as sigma(m_nu) is\nsmaller than the lower limits to the neutrino masses implied from the neutrino\noscillation experiments.

The fluctuations\nmodulate the X-ray emitting region as they move inwards and can produce\ntemporal-frequency-dependent lags between energy bands, and energy-dependent\npower spectral densities (PSDs) as a result of the different emissivity\nprofiles, which may be expected at different X-ray energies.

We find that a geometrically thick flow with large viscosity\nparameter is favoured, and confirm that the predicted lags are quite robust to\nchanges in the emissivity profile, and physical parameters of the accretion\nflow, which may help to explain the similarity of the lag spectra in the\nlow/hard and high/soft states of Cyg X-1.

At low current amplitudes, the first harmonic\ndominates in the frequency spectrum of the voltage, and at sufficiently high\ncurrent amplitudes, the amplitude of the second harmonic becomes higher than\nthat of the first harmonic. For air-annealed ribbons, the asymmetric two-peak\nbehaviour of the field dependences of the harmonic amplitudes was observed,\nwhich is related to the coupling between the amorphous phase and surface\ncrystalline layers appearing after annealing. For vacuum-annealed samples, the\nfirst harmonic has a maximum at zero external field, and the field dependence\nof the second harmonic exhibits symmetric two-peak behaviour. The experimental\nresults are interpreted in terms of a quasi-static rotational model. It is\nshown that the appearance of the second harmonic in the pick-up coil voltage is\nrelated to the anti-symmetrical distribution of the transverse field induced by\nthe current. The calculated dependences are in a qualitative agreement with the\nexperimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2005 06:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Pr 3d$_{5/2}$ core level and valence band (VB) were recorded\nusing Mg K$_\\beta$ source. The core level spectrum shows that the 3d$_{5/2}$\nlevel is split into two components of multiplicity 4 and 2, respectively due to\ncoupling of the spin states of the hole in 3d$_{5/2}$ with Pr 4f holes spin\nstate. The observed splitting is 4.5 eV. The VB spectrum is interpreted using\ndensity of states (DOS) calculations under LDA and LDA+U. It is noted that LDA\nis not sufficient to explain the observed VB spectrum. Inclusion of on-site\nCoulomb correlation for Co 3d electrons in LDA+U calculations gives DOS which\nis useful in qualitative explanation of the ground state. However, it is\nnecessary to include interactions between Pr 4f electrons to get better\nagreement with experimental VB spectrum. It is seen that the VB consists of Pr\n4f, Co 3d and O 2p states. Pr 4f, Co 3d and O 2p bands are highly mixed\nindicating strong hybridization of these three states. The band near the Fermi\nlevel has about equal contributions from Pr 4f and O 2p states with somewhat\nsmaller contribution from Co 3d states. Thus in the Zaanen, Sawatzky, and Allen\nscheme PrCoO$_3$ can be considered as charge transfer insulator. The charge\ntransfer energy $\\Delta$ can be obtained using LDA DOS calculations and the\nCoulomb-exchange energy U' from LDA+U. The explicit values for PrCoO$_3$ are\n$\\Delta$ = 3.9 eV and U' = 5.5 eV; the crystal field splitting and 3d bandwidth\nof Co ions are also found to be 2.8 and 1.8 eV, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2005 13:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Firstly, a departure function is introduced\nas the difference between the tensorial invariant measured over the real\nstructure and that computed for a reference uniform structure. Secondly, a\nresistivity anomaly occurrence probability (RAOP) function is defined as a\nnormalised crosscorrelation involving the experimental departure function and a\nscanning function derived analytically using the Frechet derivative of the\nelectric potential for the reference uniform structure.

Rev. Lett. 86, 5188]\noutlines a scheme that allows one to use measurement on a large set of\nentangled quantum systems in what is known as a cluster state to undertake\nquantum computations. The model itself and many works dedicated to it involve\nusing entangled qubits. In this paper we consider the issue of using entangled\nqudits instead. We present a complete framework for cluster state quantum\ncomputation using qudits, which not only contains the features of the original\nqubit model but also contains the new idea of adaptive computation: via a\nchange in the classical computation that helps to correct the errors that are\ninherent in the model, the implemented quantum computation can be changed. This\nfeature arises through the extra degrees of freedom that appear when using\nqudits. Finally, for prime dimensions, we give a very explicit description of\nthe model, making use of mutually unbiased bases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2005 11:01:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2006 14:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Includes also several published papers","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  The coherence properties of broadband down converted light are investigated\ntheoretically and experimentally in both the classical and quantum mechanical\nframeworks. Although broadband down converted light is one-photon incoherent\nnoise, it possesses unique two-photon coherence. Thus, for performing\ntwo-photon processes, down-converted light is equivalent to coherent ultrashort\npulses in some aspects and to coherent CW laser radiation in others. This\nequivalence is theoretically established and experimentally demonstrated in the\nclassical, high-power regime. Two applications that take advantage of\nmulti-photon coherence are then described in detail; one for optical spread\nspectrum communication and the other for sub-diffraction limit optical\nlithography. A key part of this research is the design and implementation of an\nefficient source that generates high-power broadband down conversion in a\ncavity. A broadband oscillation in the cavity is ensured by a mechanism very\nsimilar to passive mode-locking of ultrashort pulse laser sources, which we\nterm as pair-wise mode locking, thus extending the equivalence to ultrashort\npulses to the light generating sources also. Finally, the quantum mechanical\nproperties of broadband down-conversion are explored experimentally, by\nperforming a two-photon process (sum frequency generation) at the low power\nlevel of entangled photon pairs. The non-classical nature of the light is\nexpressed by a linear intensity dependence of the non-linear process. Temporal\nshaping with femtosecond resolution of the entangled photon pairs is\ndemonstrated using this non-linear interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2005 14:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
