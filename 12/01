Additionally, the shape of the total halo luminosity depends on the slope\nof the subhalo mass function. For these high mass, cluster sized haloes, we\nfind that total luminosity scales as L_tot ~ M^0.88, while the luminosity of\nthe first brightest galaxy has a much weaker dependence on halo mass, L_1 ~\nM^0.28, in good agreement with observations and previous results. At low mass,\nthe resulting slope of the mass-luminosity relation depends strongly of the\nfaint end slope of the luminosity function, and we obtain a steep relation,\nwith approximately L ~ M^4.5 in the K-band. The average number of galaxies per\nhalo/cluster is also in very good agreement with observations, scaling as\nM^0.9.

We look at three tracers of star-formation history (i-band\nabsolute magnitude M_i, [g-r] color, and Halpha emission line equivalent width)\nand two indicators of galaxy morphology (surface brightness and radial\nconcentration) for 52,569 galaxies in the redshift range of 0.015<z<0.068. We\nfind that our morphology indicators relate to the clustocentric distance only\nindirectly through their relationships with stellar population and\nstarformation rate. Galaxies that are near the cluster center tend to be more\nluminous, redder and have lower Halpha EW (ie, lower star-formation rates) than\nthose that lie near or outside the virial radius of the cluster. The detailed\nrelationships between these galaxy properties and clustocentric distance depend\non cluster richness. For richer clusters, we find that (i) the transition in\ncolor and Halpha EW from cluster center to field values is more abrupt and\noccurs closer to the cluster virial radius, and (ii) the color and Halpha EW\ndistributions are overall narrower than in less rich clusters. We also find\nthat the radial gradient seen in the luminosity distribution is strongest\naround the smaller clusters and decreases as cluster richness increases. We\nfind there is a `characteristic distance' at around one virial radius (the\ninfall region) where the change with radius of galaxy property distributions is\nmost dramatic, but we find no evidence for infall-triggered star bursts. These\nresults suggest that galaxies `know' the distance to, and the size of, their\nnearest cluster and they express this information in their star-formation\nhistories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2005 21:19:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2005 03:01:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2005 00:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2006 22:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Method: Observations were made with the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array at 13 and 20 cm.

A multiwavelength search for\ncounterparts to the compact central X-ray source was made. Results: We compiled\na new catalogue of 31 small diameter radio sources, including the previously\nknown source PMN J0853-4620, listing the integrated flux densities at 20 cm\nand, for half of the sources, the flux densities at 13 cm with the\ncorresponding spectral indices.

During reionization peculiar motion of free electrons induces the\nDoppler anisotropy of the CMB, while density fluctuations of neutral hydrogen\ninduce the 21-cm line anisotropy. In our simplified model of inhomogeneous\nreionization, a positive correlation arises as the universe reionizes whereas a\nnegative correlation arises as it recombines; thus, the sign of the correlation\nprovides information on the reionization history which cannot be obtained by\npresently. The signal comes mainly from large scales (k~0.01 Mpc^-1) where\nlinear perturbation theory is valid and complexity due to patchy reionization\nis averaged out. Since the Doppler signal comes from ionized regions and the\n21-cm comes from neutral ones, the correlation has a well-defined peak(s) in\nredshift when the ionization fraction of the universe is about half.\nFurthermore, the cross-correlation is much less sensitive to systematic errors,\nespecially foreground emission, than the auto-correlation of 21-cm lines: this\nis analogous to the temperature-polarization correlation of the CMB being more\nimmune to systematic errors than the polarization-polarization. Therefore, we\nargue that the Doppler-21cm correlation provides a robust measurement of the\n21-cm anisotropy, which can also be used as a diagnostic tool for detected\nsignals in the 21-cm data -- detection of the cross-correlation provides the\nstrongest confirmation that the signal is of cosmological origin.

We examine the\ncontributions and luminosity functions of various kinds of candidate objects\nwhich are proposed either by previous authors or by ourselves. Methods. We\nconduct a population synthesis calculation based on Hurley et al.'s rapid\nbinary evolution code. Several candidate models, i.e. wind-accreting neutron\nstars, intermediate polars, low mass X-ray binaries, young pulsars and massive\nstars with strong winds, are incorporated into our calculation. We also take\nthe geometric effect of the accretion disk into account for Roche lobe overflow\nX-ray binaries. Results. Our results show that neutron star low-mass X-ray\nbinaries contribute significantly to the observed sources. We also point out\nthat wind-accreting neutron stars contribute negligibly to these sources due to\npropeller effect, and the intermediate polars play a minor role in accounting\nfor the faint X-ray sources in both Wang et al. and Muno et al. survey. It\nshould be mentioned that the majority of the sources in the survey field of\nWang et al. are still beyond our expectation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2005 10:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The Vertex-Vertex\nProblem has been studied extensively.

By\nshowing that the Minimum Edge-Vertex Problem can be polynomially transformed\ninto the Minimum Weight Perfect Matching Problem, we obtain that the Minimum\nEdge-Vertex Problem can be solved in polynomial time in general.

The study is based on a Hamiltonian approach. It\nconcentrates on values of the density ratio close to a critical one, where the\nsupercritical bifurcation changes to the subcritical one. As the solitary wave\nvelocity approaches the minimum phase velocity of linear interfacial waves (the\nbifurcation point), the solitary wave solutions transform into envelope\nsolitons. In order to describe their behavior and bifurcations, a generalized\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation describing the behavior of solitons and\ntheir bifurcations is derived. In comparison with the classical NLS equation\nthis equation takes into account three additional nonlinear terms: the\nso-called Lifshitz term responsible for pulse steepening, a nonlocal term\nanalogous to that first found by Dysthe for gravity waves and the six-wave\ninteraction term. We study both analytically and numerically two solitary wave\nfamilies of this equation for values of the density ratio $\\rho$ that are both\nabove and below the critical density ratio $\\rho_{cr}$. For $\\rho>\\rho_{cr}$,\nthe soliton solution can be found explicitly at the bifurcation point.

However, although the Stern-Gerlach experiment plays an\nessential role in the teaching of quantum mechanics, no complete analysis of\nthis experiment using Pauli spinors is presented in the pedagogical literature.\nThis paper presents such an analysis and develops implications for the theory\nof quantum measurement.\n  We first propose an analytic expression of both the wave function and the\nprobability density in the Stern-Gerlach experiment. Our explicit solution is\nobtained via a complete integration of the Pauli equation over time and space.\nThe probability density evolution describes a slipping of the wave packet into\ntwo separate packets due to the measurement device, but it cannot account for\nimpacts.\n  We therefore calculate the de Broglie-Bohm trajectories, which not only\nexplain impacts naturally, but also accounts for the spin quantization\nfollowing the magnetic field gradient. It is then possible to propose a clear\nexplanation of measurement effects in the Stern-Gerlach experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2005 20:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is shown that, albeit the\n(possibly strong) coupling between atom and cavity, it is sufficient for\nderiving the momentum diffusion to consider that the atom couples to a mean\ncavity field, which gives a first contribution, and that the cavity mode\ncouples to a mean atomic dipole, giving a second contribution. Both\ncontributions have an intuitive form and present a clear symmetry. The total\ndiffusion is the sum of these two contributions plus the diffusion originating\nfrom the fluctuations of the forces due to the coupling to the vacuum modes\nother than the cavity mode (the so called spontaneous emission term).
