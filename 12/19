However it remains\nunclear whether and how this primordial pollution can occur within GCs. We here\npropose a new scenario in which primordial pollution of GCs is highly likely to\noccur if GCs are located in the central regions of high redshift dark matter\nsubhalos that can host low-mass dwarf galaxies. In this scenario, gas ejected\nfrom the first generation of stars of GCs can be effectively trapped in the\ndeep gravitational potential of their host halos and consequently can be\nconsumed for the formation of the second generation of stars without losing a\nsignificant amount of gas by ram pressure stripping of interstellar and\nintergalactic medium. During merging of these halos with the proto-Galaxy, the\nhalos are completely destroyed owing to the strong tidal field of the Galaxy.\nThe self-polluted GCs located initially in the central regions of the halos can\nsurvive from tidal destruction owing to their compactness and finally become\nthe Galactic halo GCs. In this scenario, ejecta of field stars surrounding the\ncentral GCs can be also converted into stars within their host dwarfs and\nfinally become the second generation of stars of GCs.

A molecular survey recently performed ahead of HH~2 supports the\nidea that the observed molecular enhancement is due to UV radiation from the HH\nobject. Aims. The aim of the present work is to determine whether all HH\nobjects with enhanced HCO$^+$ emission ahead of them also exhibit the same\nenhanced chemistry as HH~2. We thus observed several molecular lines at several\npositions ahead of five Herbig-Haro objects where enhanced HCO$^+$ emission was\npreviously observed. Methods. We mapped the five Herbig-Haro objects using the\nIRAM-30 m. For each position we searched for more than one molecular species,\nand where possible for more than one transition per species. We then estimated\nthe averaged beam column densities for all species observed and also performed\nLVG analyses to constrain the physical properties of the gas. Results. The\nchemically richest quiescent gas is found ahead of the HH~7-11 complex, in\nparticular at the HH~7-11 A position. In some regions we also detected a high\nvelocity gas component. We find that the gas densities are always higher than\nthose typical of a molecular cloud while the derived temperatures are always\nquite low, ranging from 10 to 25 K.

To better judge on some of the\ncompeting scenarios, we present spectroscopic [Fe/H] estimates for a sample of\n26 compact objects in the central region of the Fornax cluster, covering the\nmagnitude range of UCDs and bright globular clusters. We find a break in the\nmetallicity distribution of compact objects at M_V ~ -11 mag (~3*10^6 M_sun):\nfor M_V<-11 mag the mean metallicity is [Fe/H]=-0.62 +/- 0.05 dex, 0.56 +/-\n0.15 dex higher than for M_V>-11 mag. This metallicity break is accompanied by\na change in the size-luminosity relation for compact objects, as deduced from\nHST-imaging: for M_V<-11 mag, r_h scales with luminosity, while for M_V>-11\nmag, r_h is almost luminosity-independent. We therefore assume a limiting\nabsolute magnitude of M_V=-11 mag between UCDs and globular clusters. The mean\nmetallicity of five Fornax dE,N nuclei included in our study is about 0.8 dex\nlower than that of the UCDs, at 4.5 sigma significance.

These states\ndisplay quantum mechanical behaviours at scales much larger than atomic\ndimensions. As in many phase transitions, defects can occur during the\ntransition to the low temperature state. The study of these defects yields\nuseful information about the nature of the transitions and of the macroscopic\nstates themselves. When cooled below the lambda temperature (~2.172 K), liquid\nhelium acquires superfluid properties, and the defects in the superfluid take\nthe form of line vortices with quantized circulation. The formation of these\nvortices has been suggested as a model for cosmological structure formation.\nHere we visualize these superfluid (or quantized) vortices by suspending\nmicron-sized solid particles of hydrogen in the fluid. The particles at low\nconcentrations arrange themselves with nearly equal spacing along vortex lines.\nThe number density of the vortex lines in a steadily rotating state compares\nwell with Feynman's prediction. For the first time, it is possible to observe\nsuperfluid turbulence in which the superfluid vortices interact, and exist in\nnetworks with complex branching. Our method makes it possible to characterize\nthe vortices during the transition across the lambda point and in the turbulent\nstate itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2005 02:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We find that whenever microwave frequency and cyclotron\nfrequency are commensurate, there is a {\\em resonance} in the longitudinal\nconductivity. This resonance has the form of the derivative of a Lorentz\nfunction; precisely at the center of the resonance, the microwave induced\nconductivity vanishes. Between the resonances there are maxima and minima, the\ndepths and precise positions of which depend on the microwave amplitude and the\nscattering rate of the impurities. We demonstrate the existence of these\nresonances by a microscopic, analytical calculation of the conductivity in\nlowest order in the microwave intensity and show here that the conductivity is\nindependent of the microwave polarization, linear or circular. We then discuss\nthe general case and predict minima in the longitudinal conductivity\ncorresponding to fractional values of the microwave frequency divided by the\ncyclotron frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2005 13:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the\nmultipartite case we consider the complete set of full-correlation Bell\ninequalities with two dichotomic observables per site, also called\nWWZB-inequalities. We show that asymptotic violation of any of these\ninequalities by a multipartite state implies that pure-state entanglement can\nbe distilled from it, although the corresponding distillation protocol may\nrequire that some of the parties join into several groups. We also obtain the\nextreme points of the set of distributions generated by measuring $N$ quantum\nsystems with two dichotomic observables per site.
