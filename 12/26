However, a coding scheme to\nachieve the feedback capacity is not available. In this paper, a coding scheme\nis proposed to achieve the feedback capacity for Gaussian channels. The coding\nscheme essentially implements the celebrated Kalman filter algorithm, and is\nequivalent to an estimation system over the same channel without feedback. It\nreveals that the achievable information rate of the feedback communication\nsystem can be alternatively given by the decay rate of the Cramer-Rao bound of\nthe associated estimation system. Thus, combined with the control theoretic\ncharacterizations of feedback communication (proposed by Elia), this implies\nthat the fundamental limitations in feedback communication, estimation, and\ncontrol coincide. This leads to a unifying perspective that integrates\ninformation, estimation, and control. We also establish the optimality of the\nKalman filtering in the sense of information transmission, a supplement to the\noptimality of Kalman filtering in the sense of information processing proposed\nby Mitter and Newton. In addition, the proposed coding scheme generalizes the\nSchalkwijk-Kailath codes and reduces the coding complexity and coding delay.\nThe construction of the coding scheme amounts to solving a finite-dimensional\noptimization problem.
