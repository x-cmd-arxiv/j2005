The resulting decoherence reduces the\nability of the quantum dot to produce spin-entangled electron-hole pairs.

Under\nhigh-intensity monochromatic radiation $\\omega$ we observe new zero-resistance\nstates (ZRS) which correspond to rational values of $\\epsilon=\\omega/\\omega_C$\n($\\omega_C$ is the cyclotron frequency) and can be associated with multiphoton\nprocesses. %Formation of these rational ZRS is accompanied by a dramatic\nreconstruction of the photoresistance spectrum which reveals diminishing,\nnarrowing, and phase reduction of the resistance peaks, as well as overall\nsuppression of resistance at $\\epsilon<1/2$. Under bichromatic radiation\n$\\omega_1,\\omega_2$ we discover new resistance minimum, possibly a precursor of\nbichromatic ZRS, which seems to originate from a frequency mixing process,\n$\\omega_1+\\omega_2$.

The ground state properties of\nthe integrable two-leg spin-1/2 and the mixed spin-(1/2,1) ladder models at\nzero temperature are analyzed by means of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz.\nSolving the TBA equations yields exact results for the critical fields and\ncritical behaviour. The thermal and magnetic properties of the models are\ninvestigated in terms of the recently introduced High Temperature Expansion\nmethod, which is discussed in detail. It is shown that in the strong coupling\nlimit the integrable spin-1/2 ladder model exhibits three quantum phases: (i) a\ngapped phase in the regime $H<H_{c1}$, (ii) a fully polarised phase for\n$H>H_{c2}$, and (iii) a Luttinger liquid magnetic phase in the regime\n$H_{c1}<H<H_{c2}$. The critical behaviour in the vicinity of the critical\npoints is of the Pokrovsky-Talapov type. The temperature-dependent thermal and\nmagnetic properties are directly evaluated from the exact free energy\nexpression and compared to known experimental results for a range of strong\ncoupling ladder compounds. Similar analysis of the mixed spin-(1/2,1) ladder\nmodel reveals a rich phase diagram, with a 1/3 and a full saturation\nmagnetisation plateau within the strong antiferromagnetic rung coupling regime.\nFor weak rung coupling, the fractional magnetisation plateau is diminished and\na new quantum phase transition occurs.

Whereas in maximum-likelihood decoding all codewords in a code are\ncompeting to be the best explanation of the received vector, under graph-cover\ndecoding all codewords in all finite covers of a Tanner graph representation of\nthe code are competing to be the best explanation. We are interested in\ngraph-cover decoding because it is a theoretical tool that can be used to show\nconnections between linear programming decoding and message-passing iterative\ndecoding. Namely, on the one hand it turns out that graph-cover decoding is\nessentially equivalent to linear programming decoding. On the other hand,\nbecause iterative, locally operating decoding algorithms like message-passing\niterative decoding cannot distinguish the underlying Tanner graph from any\ncovering graph, graph-cover decoding can serve as a model to explain the\nbehavior of message-passing iterative decoding. Understanding the behavior of\ngraph-cover decoding is tantamount to understanding the so-called fundamental\npolytope.

Out of many at least {\\it one}\ngenerically obtains a large vacuum expectation value during inflation. Gauge\nbosons and Gauginos then obtain large masses by virtue of the Higgs mechanism.\nThis makes the rate of thermalization after the end of inflation very small and\nas a result the Universe enters a {\\it quasi-thermal phase} after the inflaton\nhas completely decayed. A full thermal equilibrium is generically established\nmuch later on when the flat direction expectation value has substantially\ndecareased. This results in low reheat temperatures, i.e., $T_{\\rm R}\\sim {\\cal\nO}({\\rm TeV})$, which are compatible with the stringent bounds arising from the\nbig bang nucleosynthesis. There are two very important implications: the\nproduction of gravitinos and generation of a baryonic asymmetry via\nleptogenesis during the quasi-thermal phase. In both the cases the abundances\ndepend not only on an effective temperature of the quasi-thermal phase (which\ncould be higher, i.e., $T\\gg T_{\\rm R}$), but also on the state of equilibrium\nin the reheat plasma. We show that there is no ``thermal gravitino problem'' at\nall within supersymmetry and we stress on a need of a new paradigm based on a\n``quasi-thermal leptogenesis'', because in the bulk of the parameter space the\n{\\it old} thermal leptogenesis cannot account for the observed baryon\nasymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2005 20:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2006 14:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

They provide stringent tests for nuclear structure\nmodels necessary for modeling astrophysical environments such as neutron stars\nand core-collapse supernovae. In anticipation of (t,3He) experiments at 115\nMeV/nucleon on nuclei of relevance (A~40-120) in the late evolution of stars,\nit is shown via a study of the 26Mg(t,3He) reaction that this probe is an\naccurate tool for extracting Gamow-Teller transition strengths. To do so, the\ndata are complemented by results from the 26Mg(3He,t) reaction at 140\nMeV/nucleon which allows for a comparison of T=2 analog states excited via the\nmirror reactions. Extracted Gamow-Teller strengths from 26Mg(t,3He) and\n26Mg(3He,t) are compared with those from 26Mg(d,2He) and 26Mg(p,n) studies,\nrespectively.

Furthermore, we test shell-model calculations using\nthe new USD-05B interaction in the sd-model space and show that it reproduces\nthe experimental Gamow-Teller strength distributions well.

In four-dimensional spacetime\ncontinuum, the orthogonal rotation is defined. It forms two sets of equations:\none set is geometrical equations, another set is the motion equations. The\nLorentz transformation can be directly derived from the geometrical equations,\nand the proper time of general relativity is well expressed by time\ndisplacement field. By the motion equations, the typical time displacement\nfield of matter motion is discussed. The research shows that the quantum field\ntheory can be established based on the concept of orthogonal rotation. On this\nsense, the quantum matter motion in physics is viewed as the orthogonal\nrotation of spacetime continuum. In this paper, it shows that there are three\ntypical quantum solutions. One is particle-like solution, one is\ngeneration-type solution, and one is pure wave type solution. For each typical\nsolution, the force fields are different. Many features of quantum field can be\nwell explained by this theoretic form. Finally, the general matter motion is\ndiscussed, the main conclusions are: (1). Geometrically, cosmic vacuum field\ncan be described by the curvature spacetime; (2). The spatial deformation of\nplanet is related with a planet electromagnetic field; (3).

However,\nmany mode pairs are excited in the presence of dispersion-induced temporal\nwalkoff of the Stokes, as witnessed by the photon-count statistics. We also\nconsider the readout of the stored atomic polarization using the anti-Stokes\nscattering process. We prove that the readout process can also be decomposed\ninto multiple mode pairs, each pair undergoing independent evolution analogous\nto a beam-splitter transformation. We show that this process can have unit\nefficiency under realistic experimental conditions. The shape of the output\nlight wave packet can be predicted. In case of unit readout efficiency it\ncontains only excitations originating from a specified atomic excitation mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2005 19:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
