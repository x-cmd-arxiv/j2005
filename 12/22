The spectro-astrometry is shown from both\nempirical and simulated data to be capable of detecting binary companions that\nare fainter by up to 6 magnitudes at separations larger than 0.1 arcsec. The\nnine targets that were previously known to be a binary are all detected. In\naddition, we report the discovery of 6 new binaries and present 5 further\npossible binaries. The resulting binary fraction of 68+/-11 per cent is the\nlargest reported for any observed sample of Herbig Ae/Be stars, presumably\nbecause of the exquisite sensitivity of spectro-astrometry for detecting binary\nsystems. The data hint that the binary frequency of the Herbig Be stars is\nlarger than for the Herbig Ae stars. The appendix presents model simulations to\nassess the capabilities of spectro-astrometry and reinforces the empirical\nfindings. Two objects, HD 87643 and Z CMa, display evidence for asymmetric\noutflows. Finally, the position angles of the binary systems have been compared\nwith available orientations of the circumprimary disc and these appear to be\nco-planar. The alignment between the circumprimary discs and the binary systems\nstrongly suggests that the formation of binaries with intermediate mass\nprimaries is due to fragmentation as the alternative, stellar capture, does not\nnaturally predict aligned discs. The aligment extends to the most massive\nB-type stars in our sample. This leads us to conclude that formation mechanisms\nthat do result in massive stars, but predict random angles beween the binaries\nand the circumprimary disks, such as stellar collisions, are also ruled out for\nthe same reason.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2005 16:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

When\ncompared to stellar-mass black holes, the low disc temperatures observed in\nsome ULXs may imply intermediate-mass black hole primaries.

The [O I] emission region of HD 100546 appears to be coinciding with\nthe dust disk, its major axis located at 150+/-11 degrees east of north.

The field equations for fermions and for\nbosons are respectively associated with geodesic motion equations and with\nlocal curvature of the considered space. The equation for fermions can restore\nall the terms of quadratic form of Dirac equation. According to the field\nequation it is found that, for the U(1) field [generalized Quantum\nElectrodynamics (QED)], when the electromagnetic fields $\\vec E$ and $\\vec B$\nsatisfy $\\vec E^2-\\vec B^2\\neq 0$, the bosons will gain masses. In this model,\na physical region is empirically defined, which can be characterized by a\ndeterminant occurring in boson field equation. Applying the field equation to\nU(3) field [generalized Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)], the quark-confining\nproperty can be understood by carrying out the boundary of physical region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2005 06:03:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2006 07:45:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2006 03:14:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2007 13:40:09 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2007 15:48:41 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2008 04:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The entanglement is explained as innate interference between the\nnon-empty state associated with the peaked piece of one particle and the empty\nstates associated with the non-peaked pieces of the others of entangled\nparticles, which inseparably join together. The correlation of the results of\nmeasurements on the ensemble of composite entangled systems is related to this\nkind of interference. Consequently, there is no nonlocal influence between\nentangled particles in measurements.

Besides, likewise,\ncommunication and computation schemes based on alleged spooky action at a\ndistance are unlikely to be promising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2005 12:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We study the situation in which the particles are\nnoninteracting. The encoding input states obey a set of physically motivated\nconstraints on the mean values of the energy and particle number. In such a\ncase, the determination of both classical and quantum capacity reduces to a\nconstrained maximization of entropy. In the case of noninteracting bosons,\nsignatures of Bose Einstein condensation can be observed in the behavior of the\ncapacity. A major motivation for these considerations is to compare the\ninformation carrying capacities of channels that carry bosons with those that\ncarry fermions. We show analytically that fermions generally provide higher\nchannel capacity, i.e., they are better suited for transferring bits as well as\nqubits, in comparison to bosons. This holds for a large range of power law\npotentials, and for moderate to high temperatures. Numerical simulations seem\nto indicate that the result holds for all temperatures. Also, we consider the\nlow temperature behavior for the three-dimensional box and harmonic trap, and\nagain we show that the fermionic capacity is higher than the bosonic one for\nsufficiently low temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2005 15:53:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2006 15:58:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2007 09:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-20"}
