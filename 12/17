We focus on the relationship between two emission\nlines commonly used as star formation rate indicators: Ha 6563 and [OII] 3727.\nThere is a strong bimodality in [OII]/Ha ratio in the full SDSS sample which\nclosely corresponds to the bimodality in rest-frame color. Nearly all of the\nline-emitting red galaxies have line ratios typical of various types of AGN --\nmost commonly LINERs, a small fraction of transition objects and, more rarely,\nSeyferts. Only ~6% of red galaxies display star-forming line ratios. A straight\nline in the [OII]-Ha equivalent width plane separates LINER-like galaxies from\nother categories. Quiescent galaxies with no detectable emission lines and\nLINER-like galaxies combine to form a single, tight red sequence in\ncolor-magnitude-concentration space. [OII] EWs in LINER- and AGN-like galaxies\ncan be as large as in star-forming galaxies. Thus, unless objects with\nAGN/LINER-like line ratios are excluded, [OII] emission cannot be used directly\nas a proxy for star formation rate. Lack of [OII] emission is generally used to\nindicate lack of star formation when post-starburst galaxies are selected at\nhigh redshift.
