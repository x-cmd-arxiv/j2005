The approach of Weber & Davis (1967) is extended\nto non-equatorial latitudes to quantify the impact of latitude-dependent\nmagnetic field distributions over a large range of stellar rotation rates and\nthermal wind properties. The analytically prescribed field patterns are\ndominated by magnetic flux concentrations at intermediate and high latitudes.\nThe global stellar mass loss rates are found to be rather insensitive to\nnon-uniformities of the surface magnetic field.

These large variations albeit\nequal amounts of total magnetic flux indicate that a classification of stellar\nsurface magnetic fields through a single field strength is insufficient, and\nthat their non-uniformity has to be taken into account. The consequences for\napplications involving magnetised stellar winds are discussed in view of the\nrotational evolution of solar-like stars and of the observational determination\nof their mass loss rates using the terminal velocity and ram pressure of the\nwind.

In this paper,\nwe study one of the more general problems, known as LCP (largest common point\nset problem): Let $\\PP$ and $\\QQ$ be two point sets in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, and let\n$\\epsilon \\geq 0$ be a tolerance parameter, the problem is to find a rigid\nmotion $\\mu$ that maximizes the cardinality of subset $\\II$ of $Q$, such that\nthe Hausdorff distance $\\distance(\\PP,\\mu(\\II)) \\leq \\epsilon$.

To\nillustrate the main ideas, we start with the single group case, i.e., pure\nmulticast, where a common information stream is requested by all the users. We\nconsider three classes of scheduling algorithms with progressively increasing\ncomplexity. The first class strives for minimum complexity by resorting to a\nstatic scheduling strategy along with memoryless decoding. Our analysis for\nthis class of scheduling algorithms reveals the existence of a static\nscheduling policy that achieves the optimal scaling law of the throughput at\nthe expense of a delay that increases exponentially with the number of users.\nThe second scheduling policy resorts to a higher complexity incremental\nredundancy encoding/decoding strategy to achieve a superior throughput-delay\ntradeoff. The third, and most complex, scheduling strategy benefits from the\ncooperation between the different users to minimize the delay while achieving\nthe optimal scaling law of the throughput. In particular, the proposed\ncooperative multicast strategy is shown to simultaneously achieve the optimal\nscaling laws of both throughput and delay. Then, we generalize our scheduling\nalgorithms to exploit the multi-group diversity available when different\ninformation streams are requested by different subsets of the user population.\nFinally, we discuss the effect of the potential gains of equipping the base\nstation with multi-transmit antennas and present simulation results that\nvalidate our theoretical claims.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2005 21:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

This background is conjectured\nto be dual to the Leigh-Strassler beta-deformation of N=4 SYM and therefore a\ngood laboratory for tests of the AdS/CFT correspondence beyond the well\nexplored AdS(5)x S(5) case. We consider different multispin configurations of\nrotating strings by allowing the strings to move in both the AdS(5) and the\ndeformed S(5) part of the Lunin-Maldacena background. For all of these\nconfigurations we compute the string energy in terms of the angular momenta and\nthe string winding numbers and thus provide the possibility of comparing our\nresults to the anomalous dimension of the corresponding dilatation operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2005 10:20:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2005 11:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-08"}
