The aim is to\nprovide a framework for studying the interplay of spin relaxation and transport\nmechanism in spintronic devices. A key element of the unified description of\ntransport inside a (nondegenerate) semiconductor is the thermoballistic current\nconsisting of electrons which move ballistically in the electric field arising\nfrom internal and external electrostatic potentials, and which are thermalized\nat randomly distributed equilibration points. The ballistic component in the\nunified description gives rise to discontinuities in the chemical potential at\nthe boundaries of the semiconductor, which are related to the Sharvin interface\nconductance. By allowing spin relaxation to occur during the ballistic motion\nbetween the equilibration points, a thermoballistic spin-polarized current and\ndensity are constructed in terms of a spin transport function. An integral\nequation for this function is derived for arbitrary values of the momentum and\nspin relaxation lengths. For field-driven transport in a homogeneous\nsemiconductor, the integral equation can be converted into a second-order\ndifferential equation that generalizes the standard spin drift-diffusion\nequation. The spin polarization in ferromagnet/semiconductor heterostructures\nis obtained by invoking continuity of the current spin polarization and\nmatching the spin-resolved chemical potentials on the ferromagnet sides of the\ninterfaces. Allowance is made for spin-selective interface resistances.\nExamples are considered which illustrate the effects of transport mechanism and\nelectric field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2005 08:43:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2005 08:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Branching fractions are obtained for the two leptonic\nchannels and eleven hadronic channels defined by their respective numbers of\ncharged particles and $\\pi^0$'s.

Some physics implications of the results are given, in\nparticular related to universality in the leptonic charged weak current,\nisospin invariance in $a_1$ decays, and the separation of vector and\naxial-vector components of the total hadronic rate. Finally, spectral functions\nare determined for the dominant hadronic modes and updates are given for\nseveral analyses.

The development\nof both components of the anisotropic flow is closely related to particle\nfreeze-out. Hadrons are emitted continuously, and different hadronic species\nare decoupled from the system at different times. These hadrons contribute\ndifferently to the formation and evolution of the elliptic flow, which can be\ndecomposed onto three components: (i) flow created by hadrons emitted from the\nsurface at the onset of the collision; (ii) flow produced by jets; (iii)\nhydrodynamic flow.

The innovative aspect of our approach, is that we\nexplicitly derive the LWR's fundamental diagram directly from the STCA's rule\nset, by assuming a stationarity condition that converts the STCA's rules into a\nset of linear inequalities. In turn, these constraints define the shape of the\nfundamental diagram, which is then specified to the LWR model. Application of\nour methodology to a simulation case study, allows us to compare the\ntempo-spatial behavior of both models.
