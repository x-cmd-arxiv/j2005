A\nset of N-body merger simulations was used to explore the morphological\nsignatures of such interactions: they are recognizable either as < 5kpc\nseparation close pairs or because of broad, low surface brightness tidal\nfeatures and asymmetries.

The analytic\ncontrol over the variance matrix of the state of the bosonic register allows us\nto track the dynamics of the entanglement.
