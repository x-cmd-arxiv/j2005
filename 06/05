We find that the star formation timescale controls when\nand where stars form in the contracting gas cloud, determines the effective\nradius at given mass, and is constrained by observation to be ten times longer\nthan the local dynamical timescale. We succeed in reproducing the observed\nglobal scaling relations under our CDM-based scenario, e.g., the Faber-Jackson\nrelation, the Kormendy relation, and the fundamental plane. An intrinsic\nscatter exists along the fundamental plane, and the origin of this scatter lies\nin differences in merging history. Galaxies that undergo major merger events\ntend to have larger effective radii and fainter surface brightnesses, which\nresult in larger masses, smaller surface brightnesses, and larger mass-to-light\nratios. We can also reproduce the observed colour-magnitude and\nmass-metallicity relations, although the scatter is larger than observed. The\nscatter arises because feedback is not very effective and star formation does\nnot terminate completely in our simulations. ~25% of accreted baryons are blown\naway in the simulations, independent of the assumed star formation timescale\nand initial mass function. Most heavy elements end up locked into stars in the\ngalaxy. The ejected metal fraction depends only on the star formation\ntimescale, and is ~2% even to rapid star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2005 16:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

A model is proposed\nin which a central supermassive black hole accretes intracluster plasma at the\nBondi rate and powers a radio source. The central radio source produces cosmic\nrays, which mix into the thermal plasma. The cosmic-ray luminosity is\nproportional to the mass accretion rate. The cosmic-ray pressure gradient\ndrives convection, which causes plasma heating. It is assumed that plasma\nheating balances radiative cooling. The plasma heating rate is self-regulating\nbecause the Bondi accretion rate is a decreasing function of the specific\nentropy near the cluster center; if heating exceeds cooling, then the central\nentropy increases, the Bondi rate and cosmic-ray luminosity decrease, and the\nconvective heating rate is reduced.

If the models for the supernova r-process are correct, then\nnucleosynthesis results could also pose a significant constraint on the remnant\nof supernova explosions, $i.e.$ neutron star or black hole. In the case of very\nmassive core collapse, a remnant stellar black hole is thought to be formed.\nIntense neutrino flux from the neutronized core and the neutrino sphere might\nsuddenly cease during the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase because of the black\nhole formation. It is interesting to explore observable consequences of such a\nneutrino flux truncation.

Although this GRB is one of the best observed so\nfar, there is substantial disagreement between different interpretations of\ndata sets on this burst in the literature. We have observed the field of\nGRB021004 with the HST at multiple epochs from 3 days until almost 10 months\nafter the burst. With STIS spectroscopy we cover the spectral region 600-1700AA\nin the restframe. From the limit on the flux recovery bluewards of the\nLyman-limit we constrain the HI column density to be above 1x10^18 cm-2 Based\non ACS and NICMOS imaging we find that the afterglow evolved achromatically\nwithin the errors. The color changes observed by other authors during the first\nfour days must be related to a stochastic phenomenon superimposed on an\nafterglow component with a constant spectral shape. This achromaticity implies\nthat the cooling break has remained on the blue side of the optical part of the\nspectrum for at least two weeks after the burst. The optical-to-X-ray slope is\nconsistent with being the same at 1.4 and 52.4 days after the burst. This\nindicates that the cooling frequency is constant and hence, according to\nfireball models, that the circumburst medium has a constant density profile.\nThe late-time slope of the lightcurve is in the range alpha_2 = 1.8-1.9, and is\ninconsistent with a single power-law. This could be due to a late-time\nflattening caused by the transition to non-relativistic expansion or due to\nexcess emission (a lightcurve `bump') 7 days after burst. The host is a\nstarburst galaxy with no evidence for dust and with strong Ly-alpha emission.\nThe afterglow was located very close (~100 pc) to the center of the host\nsuggesting that the progenitor was associated with a circumnuclear starburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2005 15:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The comparison is based on the secure communication rate as a\nfunction of distance for three QKD protocols: the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84),\nthe Bennett, Brassard, and Mermin 1992 (BBM92), and the coherent differential\nphase shift keying (DPSK). We show that the up-conversion detector allows for\nhigher communication rates and longer communication distances than the commonly\nused InGaAs/InP APD for all the three QKD protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2005 16:40:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2005 15:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
