The map includes the BN/KL region, the Trapezium, and\nOMC-1 South. Excluding BN/KL, we detect 91 point sources, with 27 known\nproplyds and over 30 ``naked'' stars showing no extended structure in HST\nimages. Within the region we surveyed, 80 percent of known proplyds show\ndetectable emission, almost 40 percent of naked stars are detected at 11.7\nmicron, and the fraction of all visible sources with IR excess emission is\nroughly 50 percent. Thermal dust emission from stars with no extended structure\nin HST images means that they have dust disks comparable to the size of our\nsolar system. Proplyds and stars with IR excess show a clear anti-correlation\nin their spatial distribution, with proplyds clustered close to theta1C, and\nother infrared sources found farther away. We suspect that the clustered\nproplyds trace the youngest 0.5 Myr age group associated with the Trapezium,\nwhile the more uniformly-distributed sources trace the older 1-2 Myr population\nof the ONC. This suggests that small disks persist for a few Myr in irradiated\nenvironments, and hints that hierarchical sub-clustering has been important.\nWithin 30 arcsec of theta1C, all proplyds are detected at 11.7 micron. The star\ntheta1D is associated with the most prominent mid-IR dust arc in the nebula. We\npropose that this arc is the consequence of theta1D being the closest member of\nthe Trapezium to the background cloud. Finally, we detect dust emission from HH\njets in Orion, including HH202, HH529, HH513, and HH514. This is the first\ndetection of mid-IR continuum emission from dust in the body of a collimated HH\njet or bow shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2005 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The formation of the early disk is modeled as the result\nof the gravitational collapse of an isothermal molecular cloud. The disk's\nviscous evolution is integrated according to two parameterizations of\nturbulence: The classical $\\alpha$ representation and a $\\beta$\nparameterization, representative of non-linear turbulence driven by the\nkeplerian shear. We apply the model to DM Tau and GM Aur, two classical T-Tauri\nstars with relatively well-characterized disks, retrieving the evolution of\ntheir surface density with time. We perform a systematic Monte-Carlo\nexploration of the parameter space (i.e. values of the $\\alpha$-$\\beta$\nparameters, and of the temperature and rotation rate in the molecular cloud) to\nfind the values that are compatible with the observed disk surface density\ndistribution, star and disk mass, age and present accretion rate. We find that\nthe observations for DM Tau require $0.001<\\alpha<0.1$ or $2\\times\n10^{-5}<\\beta<5\\times 10^{-4}$.

Within this theory the puzzling physics of the\ncuprates is shown to be a behavior specific of their structure, within the\nregime of a Mott transition. The translational symmetry within the CuO_2 planes\nis disturbed by dynamical stripe-like inhomogeneities, which provide\nquasi-one-dimensional segments where the large-U scenario of separation between\nspin and charge is materialized. However, these charge carriers gain itineracy\nonly due to the coupling with electrons in the regions where spin and charge\nare inseparable. Consequently a two-component scenario is obtained of heavy and\nlight charge carriers, which are coupled through spin carriers. The theory\ncould explain all the anomalous properties of the cuprates that were studied by\nit, including those observed in transport, tunneling, ARPES, and\nneutron-scattering results, the pairing mechanism and its symmetry, the\nobserved phase diagram, and the occurrence of intrinsic nanoscale\nheterogeneity.

An effective cutoff is implemented by embedding the physical SU(N)\ntheory in a spontaneously broken SU(N|N) Yang-Mills theory. To facilitate\ncomputations within this scheme, which proceed at every step without fixing the\ngauge, we develop a set of diagrammatic techniques.

The technique applies both to systems with conventional\nLyapunov-stable target dynamics and to ones of which the desired dynamics\naround the target set is nonequilibrium and in general unstable in the Lyapunov\nsense. Mathematical models of uncertainties are allowed to be nonlinearly\nparametrized, smooth, and monotonic functions of linear functionals of the\nparameters. We illustrate with applications how the proposed method leads to\ncontrol algorithms. In particular we show that the mere existence of nonlinear\noperator gains for the desired dynamics guarantees that system solutions are\nbounded, reach a neighborhood of the target set, and mismatches between the\nmodeled uncertainties and uncertainty compensator vanish with time.

Both the strategies are optimized to\nminimize the detrimental effects due to losses and thermal noise along the\npropagation. The comparison between the local and the nonlocal protocol shows\nthat telecloning is more effective than local cloning for a wide range of noise\nparameters. Our results indicate that nonlocal strategies can be more robust\nagainst noise than local ones, thus being suitable candidates to play a major\nrole in quantum information networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2005 19:55:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

A basic problem is to recognize the features\nof quantum systems responsible for those phenomena. One of such important\nfeatures is that non-commuting quantum states cannot be broadcast: two copies\ncannot be obtained out of a single copy, not even reproduced marginally on\nseparate systems. We focus on the difference of information contents between\none copy and two copies which is a basic manifestation of the gap between\nquantum and classical information.
