Using an incremental modelling, this law\nshall be interpreted as a pseudo-Poisson coefficient. We combine these two\nfeatures to solve the problem of an axial compression under undrained\ncondition. We demonstrate that the sample is submitted to a bifurcation of the\ntranscritical type when it reaches the q=Mp line. This allows extending the\nnotion of the characteristic state introduced by Luong to other situations and\nto anisotropic systems.

It is an essential\napproach to analyze turbulence data present in meteorological, physical,\nchemical, biological and mechanical phenomena. One of its very fundamental\nassumptions is that turbulence is a stochastic Gaussian process in small\nscales5. However, experiment data at finite Reynolds numbers have observed a\nclear departure from the Gaussian. In this study, by replacing the standard\nLaplacian representation of dissipation in the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation with\nthe fractional Laplacian, we obtain the fractional NS equation underlying the\nLevy stable distribution which exhibits a non-Gaussian heavy trail and\nfractional frequency power law dissipation. The dimensional analysis of this\nequation turns out a new scaling of turbulences, called the Levy-Kolmogorov\nscaling, whose scaling exponent ranges from -3 to -5/3 corresponding to\ndifferent Levy processes and reduces to the limiting Kolmogorov scaling -5/3\nunderlying a Gaussian process. The truncated Levy process and multi-scaling due\nto the boundary effect is also discussed. Finally, we further extend our model\nto reflecting the history-dependent fractional Brownian motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2005 08:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here we present an alternative approach to optical QIP, based on the\nuse of weak cross-Kerr nonlinearities and homodyne measurements. We show how\nthis approach provides the fundamental building blocks for highly efficient\nnon-absorbing single photon number resolving detectors, two qubit parity\ndetectors, Bell state measurements and finally near deterministic control-not\n(CNOT) gates. These are essential QIP devices\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2005 01:58:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2005 23:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
