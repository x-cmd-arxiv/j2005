It implies\nthat the phonon couplings to the qubit play a subordinate role, resulting in\nthe decoherence of the qubit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2005 17:18:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2005 13:04:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2005 09:26:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2006 08:21:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Often it is found that the equilibrium mixed state\nof a spin system is not suitable as an initial state for computation and a\ndefinite initial state is required to be prepared prior to the computation. As\nthese preferred initial states are non-equilibrium states, they are not\nstationary and are destroyed with time as the spin system relaxes toward its\nequilibrium, introducing error in computation. Since it is not possible to cut\noff the relaxation processes completely, attempts are going on to develop\nalternate strategies like Quantum Error Correction Codes or Noiseless\nSubsystems. Here we study the relaxation behavior of various Pseudo Pure States\nand analyze the role of Cross terms between different relaxation processes,\nknown as Cross-correlation. It is found that while cross-correlations\naccelerate the relaxation of certain pseudo pure states, they retard that of\nothers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2005 17:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
