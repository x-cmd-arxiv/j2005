The inferred circumstellar disk masses are\nlog-normally distributed with a mean mass of ~0.005 solar masses and a large\ndispersion (0.5 dex).

Consequently, although highly useful, the above\nmodels have implicit limitations, and this is illustrated here through their\napplication to a number of real galaxy density profiles. On the other hand, the\nanalytical density profile given by Prugniel & Simien (1997) closely matches\nthe deprojected form of Sersic R^{1/n} light-profiles - including deprojected\nexponential light-profiles. It is thus applicable for describing bulges in\nspiral galaxies, dwarf elliptical galaxies, and both ordinary and giant\nelliptical galaxies. Here we provide simple equations, in terms of elementary\nand special functions, for the gravitational potential and force associated\nwith this density profile. Furthermore, to match galaxies with partially\ndepleted cores, and better explore the supermassive black hole / galaxy\nconnection, we have added a power-law core to this density profile and derived\nsimilar expressions for the potential and force of this hybrid profile.\nExpressions for the mass and velocity dispersion, assuming isotropy, are also\ngiven. These models may also prove appropriate for describing the dark matter\ndistribution in halos formed from LCDM cosmological simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2005 03:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2005 09:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-26"}

Indeed the observed phase correlations for the galaxies in the\nrange of absolute magnitude -22<Mr<-18 agree well with those for Lambda CDM\npredictions with sigma8=0.9 evolved from Gaussian initial condition.

Previously reported\ncluster-to-cluster variations of the LF faint-end slope are due to the use of a\nmetric cluster aperture for computing the LF of clusters of different masses.\n  We determine the composite LF for early- and late-type galaxies, where the\ntyping is based on the galaxy u-r colors.

That planet's secular perturbations cause the orbits\nof the planetesimals to evolve in such a way that at any one time planetesimals\nat the same distance from the star have common pericentres and eccentricities.\nThis causes the surface density distribution of an extended planetesimal disk\nto exhibit two spirals, one exterior the other interior to the planet's orbit.\nThese two spirals unwind in different directions and their structure is\ndescribed by two parameters: the time since the planet was introduced and the\nplanet's eccentricity. At late times the spirals become tightly wound and the\noffset centre of symmetry of the pericentre glow approximation is recovered.\nComparison with spiral structure seen in the HD141569 disk shows that its\nspiral at 325 AU is similar to that caused by introducing a planet 5 Myr ago\nwith a mass 0.2-2M_Jup orbiting at 235-250 AU with an eccentricity of 0.05-0.2;\nlikewise a Saturn mass planet at 150 AU would cause structure like that seen at\n200 AU.

A local quantum critical\npicture has emerged, in which magnetic interactions suppress Kondo screening\nprecisely at the magnetic quantum critical point (QCP).

To investigate, we\ncalculate the image system for point forces (Stokeslets) oriented perpendicular\nand parallel to a surface with a finite slip length, analogous to Blake's\nsolution for a Stokeslet near a no-slip wall.

The case of a single chiral superfield gives\nrise to splitting of the NLSM potentials, whereas the case of several chiral\nsuperfields results in smearing (or fuzziness) of the NLSM potentials, while\nboth effects are controlled by the auxiliary fields. We eliminate the auxiliary\nfields by solving their algebraic equations of motion, and demonstrate that the\nresults are dependent upon whether the auxiliary integrations responsible for\nthe fuzziness are performed before or after elimination of the auxiliary\nfields. There is no ambiguity in the case of splitting, i.e. for a single\nchiral superfield. Fully explicit results are derived in the case of the N=1/2\nsupersymmetric NAC-deformed CP(n) NLSM in four dimensions.

We show that, differently from the case of discrimination\nbetween unitary transformations, the use of entanglement with an ancillary\nsystem can strictly improve the discrimination, and any maximally entangled\nstate allows to achieve the optimal discrimination. We also provide a simple\nnecessary and sufficient condition in terms of the structure of the channels\nfor which the ultimate minimum error probability can be achieved without\nentanglement assistance. When such a condition is satisfied, the optimal input\nstate is simply an eigenstate of one of the Pauli matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2005 07:55:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
