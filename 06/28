The combination of the pressure buildup by the\nupflow and the cooling of the upper layers of an emerged flux tube by radiative\nlosses at the surface lead to a progressive weakening of the magnetic field in\nseveral Mm depth. When the field strength has become sufficiently low,\nconvective motions and the fluting instability disrupt the flux tube into thin,\npassively advected flux fragments, thus providing a dynamical disconnection of\nthe emerged part from its roots. We substantiate this scenario by considering\nthe quasi-static evolution of a sunspot model under the effects of radiative\ncooling, convective energy transport, and pressure buildup by a prescribed\ninflow at the bottom of the model.

In particular, we find that, given our assumptions, spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) can be characterized by two distance-independent\nparameters, the luminosity-to-mass ratio, $L/M$, and the surface density,\n$\\Sigma$, for a set of two functions, namely, the density profile and the\nopacity curve.

These stellar\nstructures extend out to several hundred kpc away from a galaxy, and consist of\nstars shed by merging subunits during the many accretion events that\ncharacterize the hierarchical assembly of galaxies. Such origin suggests that\nouter luminous halos are ubiquitous and that they should appear as an excess of\nlight over extrapolations of the galaxy's inner profile beyond its traditional\nluminous radius. The mass profile of the accreted stellar component is well\napproximated by a model where the logarithmic slope steepens monotonically with\nradius; from -3 at the luminous edge of the galaxy to -4 or steeper near the\nvirial radius of the system.

As\nwith other (sometimes confirmed) ultracompact LMXBs, 2S 0918-549 is observed to\nhave a high neon-to-oxygen abundance ratio (Juett et al. 2001) which has been\nused to argue that the companion star is a CO or ONe white dwarf.

In this paper,\nwe argue that the companion star in 2S 0918-549 is a helium white dwarf We\nfirst present a Type I X-ray burst from 2S 0918-549 with a long duration of 40\nminutes. We show that this burst is naturally explained by accretion of pure\nhelium at the inferred accretion rate of ~0.01 times the Eddington accretion\nrate. At higher accretion rates of ~0.1 Eddington, hydrogen is required to\nexplain long duration bursts. However, at low rates the long duration is due to\nthe large amount of helium that accumulates prior to the burst. We show that it\nis possible to form a helium white dwarf donor in an ultracompact binary if\naccretion starts during the first ascent of the giant branch, when the core is\nmade of predominantly helium. Furthermore, this scenario naturally explains the\nhigh neon-to-oxgen ratio, without requiring a CO or ONe white dwarf companion.\nThe only observational aspect of 2S 0918-549 that we cannot explain is the\nabsence of helium lines in the optical spectrum.

A common view is that they are largely disordered\nanalogs of elementary excitations in crystals, supplemented by two level\nsystems which are chemically local entities coming from disorder. A radical\nrevision of this picture argues that the excitations in low temperature glasses\nare deeply connected to the energy landscape of the glass when it vitrifies:\nthe excitations are not low excited states built on a single ground state but\nlocally defined resonances, high in the energy spectrum of a solid. According\nto a semiclassical analysis, the two level systems involve resonant collective\ntunneling motions of around two hundred molecular units which are relics of the\nmosaic of cooperative motions at the glass transition temperature $T_g$. The\ndensity of states of the TLS is determined by $T_g$ and the mosaic's length\nscale, which is a weak function of the cooling rate. The universality of phonon\nscattering in insulating glasses is explained. The Boson Peak and the plateau\nin thermal conductivity, observed at higher temperatures, are also\nquantitatively understood within the picture as arising from the same\ncooperative motions, but now accompanied by thermal activation of the mosaic's\nvibrational modes. The dynamics of some of the local structural transitions\nhave significant quantum corrections to the semiclassical picture. These\ncorrections lead to a deviation of the heat capacity and conductivity from the\nstandard tunneling model results and explain the anomalous time dependence of\nthe heat capacity. Interaction between tunneling centers contributes to the\nlarge and negative value of the Gr\\\"{u}neisen parameter often observed in\nglasses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2005 20:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The latter model gives predictions for\nthe neutrino-Dirac Yukawa coupling matrix, once free parameters in the model\nare appropriately fixed to accommodate the recent neutrino oscillation data.\nUsing this unambiguous neutrino-Dirac Yukawa couplings, we calculate the LFV\nleptonic and SL decay processes assuming the minimal supergravity scenario. A\nvery detailed numerical analysis is done to constrain the MSSM parameters.\nNumerical results for SL LFV processes are given, for instance for tau -> e\n(mu) pi0, tau -> e (mu) eta, tau -> e (mu) eta', tau -> e (mu) rho0, tau -> e\n(mu) phi, tau -> e (mu) omega, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2005 14:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

While in Gentzen-style proof trees sibling (or cousin, etc.)\nsequents are disjoint sequences of formulas, in cirquent calculus they are\npermitted to share elements. Explicitly allowing or disallowing shared\nresources and thus taking to a more subtle level the resource-awareness\nintuitions underlying substructural logics, cirquent calculus offers much\ngreater flexibility and power than sequent calculus does. A need for\nsubstantially new deductive tools came with the birth of computability logic\n(see http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html) - the semantically constructed\nformal theory of computational resources, which has stubbornly resisted any\naxiomatization attempts within the framework of traditional syntactic\napproaches. Cirquent calculus breaks the ice. Removing contraction from the\nfull collection of its rules yields a sound and complete system for the basic\nfragment CL5 of computability logic. Doing the same in sequent calculus, on the\nother hand, throws out the baby with the bath water, resulting in the strictly\nweaker affine logic. An implied claim of computability logic is that it is CL5\nrather than affine logic that adequately materializes the resource philosophy\ntraditionally associated with the latter.

We\nshow that the back action of the cavity field on the sample significantly\nincreases the possibility of microwave emission. This radiation process can be\nsupperradiance or a maser-like effect, depending on the strength of the\ndephasing. Our model provides further insight to the theoretical understanding\nof the bursts of electromagnetic radiation observed in recent experiments\naccompanying the resonant quantum tunneling of magnetization. The experimental\nfindings up to now can all be explained as being a maser effect rather than\nsuperradiance. The results of our theory scale similarly to the experimental\nfindings, i.e., with increasing sweep rate of the external magnetic field, the\nemission peaks are shifted towards higher field values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2005 14:51:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2005 11:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
