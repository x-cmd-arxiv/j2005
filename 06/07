Optically, it is a small (R_25 = 990 pc), faint (M_B of -14.0) Im\nwith a slightly boxy shape. In HI, DDO 43 has an extended (R_HI/R_Ho = 2.8) gas\nenvelope. There is a high density ridge associated with the optical body of the\ngalaxy, containing several higher density knots and lower density holes. The\nlargest hole is ~850x530 pc. No expansion is detected, so it must be relatively\nold. The largest and potentially oldest (7-70 Myr) of the six identified star\nclusters is located at the western edge of the hole. Four of the other clusters\nare located near high density peaks. There are several HII regions, most of\nwhich are associated with peaks in the HI surface density. The overall star\nformation rate is average for its type. In many ways, DDO 43 is a very typical\ndwarf irregular galaxy. Its HI morphology is consistent with a history of\nepisodes of localized star ormation that create holes and shells in the ISM,\nsome of which can overlap. These features are located within the area of\nsolid-body rotation in the galaxy; the lack of shear in these small systems\nallows such structures to persist for long periods of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2005 16:07:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We summarize the major effects of strong\nmagnetic fields on the rates of the above reactions and illustrate these\neffects with a simple supernova model. Due to parity violation of weak\ninteraction the heating rates are asymmetric even for a uniform magnetic field.\nThe cooling rates are also asymmetric for nonuniform fields. The most dramatic\neffect of strong magnetic fields of 10^16 G is suppression of the cooling rates\nby changing the equations of state through the phase space of electrons and\npositrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2005 00:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

In our work, we differentiate\nbetween the relay, cooperative broadcast (down-link), and cooperative\nmultiple-access (up-link) channels. For the relay channel, we investigate two\nclasses of cooperation schemes; namely, Amplify and Forward (AF) protocols and\nDecode and Forward (DF) protocols. For the first class, we establish an upper\nbound on the achievable diversity-multiplexing tradeoff with a single relay. We\nthen construct a new AF protocol that achieves this upper bound. The proposed\nalgorithm is then extended to the general case with N-1 relays where it is\nshown to outperform the space-time coded protocol of Laneman and Worenell\nwithout requiring decoding/encoding at the relays. For the class of DF\nprotocols, we develop a dynamic decode and forward (DDF) protocol that achieves\nthe optimal tradeoff for multiplexing gains 0 < r < 1/N. Furthermore, with a\nsingle relay, the DDF protocol is shown to dominate the class of AF protocols\nfor all multiplexing gains. The superiority of the DDF protocol is shown to be\nmore significant in the cooperative broadcast channel. The situation is\nreversed in the cooperative multiple-access channel where we propose a new AF\nprotocol that achieves the optimal tradeoff for all multiplexing gains. A\ndistinguishing feature of the proposed protocols in the three scenarios is that\nthey do not rely on orthogonal subspaces, allowing for a more efficient use of\nresources. In fact, using our results one can argue that the sub-optimality of\npreviously proposed protocols stems from their use of orthogonal subspaces\nrather than the half-duplex constraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2005 02:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-16"}
