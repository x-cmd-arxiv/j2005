The depicted spacetime which is type\n[II,(II)], by Petrov classification, is an exact solution of the Einstein\nequations and contains two horizons. The equation of state in the radial\ndirection, is a well-behaved function of the density and smoothly reproduces\nvacuum-like behavior near r=0 while tending to a polytrope at larger r, low\ndensity, values. The final equilibrium configuration comprises of a de\nSitter-like inner core surrounded by a family of 2-surfaces of matter fields\nwith variable equation of state. The fields are all concentrated in the\nvicinity of the radial center r=0. The solution depicts a spacetime that is\nasymptotically Schwarzschild at large r, while it becomes de Sitter-like for\nvanishing r. Possible physical interpretations of the macro-state of the black\nhole interior in the model are offered. We find that the possible state admits\ntwo equally viable interpretations, namely either a quintessential intermediary\nregion or a phase transition in which a two-fluid system is in both dynamic and\nthermodynamic equilibrium. We estimate the ratio of pure matter present to the\ntotal energy and in both (interpretations) cases find it to be virtually the\nsame, being 0.83. Finally, the well-behaved dependence of the density and\npressure on the radial coordinate provides some insight on dealing with the\ninformation loss paradox.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2005 22:45:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2005 20:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Horodecki et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 (2005)]. More detailed\nproofs, discussion and examples are provided of the main results. Namely, we\ndemonstrate that all quantum cryptographic protocols can be recast in a way\nwhich looks like entanglement theory, with the only change being that instead\nof distilling EPR pairs, the parties distill private states. The form of these\ngeneral private states are given, and we show that there are a number of useful\nways of expressing them. Some of the private states can be approximated by\ncertain states which are bound entangled. Thus distillable entanglement is not\na requirement for a private key. We find that such bound entangled states are\nuseful for a cryptographic primitive we call a controlled private quantum\nchannel. We also find a general class of states which have negative partial\ntranspose (are NPT), but which appear to be bound entangled. The relative\nentropy distance is shown to be an upper bound on the rate of key. This allows\nus to compute the exact value of distillable key for a certain class of private\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2005 19:52:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2008 13:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

In this note\nwe pursue these studies for the case of multi-particle systems. We use as a\nprototype the degenerate electron gas whose dynamics is well known in the\ncommutative limit. Our central aim here is to understand qualitatively, rather\nthan quantitatively, the main modifications induced by the presence of\nnoncommutative coordinates. We shall first see that the noncommutativity\nmodifies the exchange correlation energy while preserving the electric\nneutrality of the model. By employing time-independent perturbation theory\ntogether with the Seiberg-Witten map we show, afterwards, that the ionization\npotential is modified by the noncommutativity. It also turns out that the\nnoncommutative parameter acts as a reference temperature. Hence, the\nnoncommutativity lifts the degeneracy of the zero temperature electron gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2005 20:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This quasi-1D geometry gives rise to scattering resonances and\nweakly localized states, whose binding energies and wavefunctions can be\nsystematically calculated. Possible applications include e.g. impurity\nscattering in ballistic quasi-1D quantum wires in mesoscopic systems and in\natomic matter wave guides. In the particular case of parabolic confinement, the\npresent formalism can also be applied to pair collision processes such as\ntwo-body interactions.
