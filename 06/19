In\ngalaxy clusters, the abundance of dwarf galaxies is in good agreement with the\nexpectation based on the subhalo mass function, whereas in galaxy groups, the\nrelatively small abundance of dwarfs conflicts with theoretical expectations.\nIn all halo systems, there is a dip in the abundance of galaxies with\nluminosities in the range ~ 2x10^8 L_sun to 10^10 L_sun, corresponding to\nsubhalo mass scales between ~ 5x10^10 M_sun to few times 10^11 M_sun.\nPhotoionization from reionization has been used to explain statistics of the\ndwarf population, with larger systems forming prior to, and smaller systems\nforming subsequent to, reionization. The observed dip in the LF is an imprint\nof small dwarf galaxies (<2x10^8 L_sun) that formed prior to reionization. The\ngalactic winds powered by supernovae in these dwarf galaxies propagate energy\nand metals to large distances such that the intergalactic medium is uniformly\nenriched to a level of 10^-3 zsun, as observed in the low-redshift Ly-alpha\nforest. The associated energy related to this metallicity raises the\nintergalactic medium temperature and the Jeans mass to a range 10^10-10^11\nM_sun at z ~ 3.4-6.0. Because the epoch of nonlinearity for halos in this mass\nrange is at z > 3.4-4.4, their gas content, hence star formation, is greatly\nsuppressed on average and leads to a dip in the observed LF at $z=0$. Larger\nhalos (M > 10^11 M_sun), becoming nonlinear at z < 3.4-4.4, have masses topping\nthe Jeans mass, where subhalo mass function based LF is again in agreement with\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2005 05:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In light of the previously proposed footprint reduction mechanism\nand variations where the formation of gauche defects are energetically negated,\nsimulations seem to suggest that decane and dodecane monolayers are generally\nequally as dependent upon the formation of gauche defects for the melting\ntransition to take place, whereas octane monolayers seem to have less\ndependence, but follow a trend that is established in previous studies of\nmelting in butane and hexane monolayers.

Expanding the velocity in power series with respect to $\\e$, we\nobtain a recurrent system of 1D inverse problems. We provide algorithms to\nsolve these problems for the zero and first-order approximations. In the\nzero-order approximation, the corresponding 1D inverse problem is reduced to a\nsystem of non-linear Volterra-type integral equations. In the first-order\napproximation, the corresponding 1D inverse problem is reduced to a system of\ncoupled linear Volterra integral equations. These equations are used for the\nnumerical reconstruction of the velocity in both layers and the interface up to\n$O(\\e^2)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2005 23:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Periods of cusp forms\ncan be regarded as elements of S_{w+2}^*. The Eichler-Shimura isomorphism\ntheorem asserts that odd (or even) periods span S_{w+2}^*. However, periods are\nnot linearly independent; in fact, they satisfy the Eichler-Shimura relations.\nThis leads to a natural question: which periods would form a basis of\nS_{w+2}^*.\n  First we give an answer to this question. Passing to the dual space S_{w+2},\nwe will determine a new basis for S_{w+2}. The even period polynomials of this\nbasis elements are expressed explicitly by means of Bernoulli polynomials.\n  Next we consider three spaces--S_{w+2}, the space of even Dedekind symbols of\nweight w with polynomial reciprocity laws, and the space of even period\npolynomials of degree w. There are natural correspondences among these three\nspaces. All these spaces are equipped with compatible action of Hecke\noperators. We will find explicit form of period polynomials and the actions of\nHecke operators on the period polynomials.\n  Finally we will obtain explicit formulas for Hecke operators on S_{w+2} in\nterms of Bernoulli numbers B_k and divisor functions sigma_k(n), which are\nquite different from the Eichler-Selberg trace formula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2005 07:05:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2006 07:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
