Another argument\nis based upon the dispersion relation for the MRI in the context of 1D\nsimulations of core collapse. Yet a third argument rests in the results of\ndirect numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsars and thick\naccretion flows. I elaborate on my previous work regarding the first argument\nabove and I briefly discuss how these three sets of results are all related. I\nalso discuss the different roles played by the magnetic tension and the\nmagnetic pressure within the context of this work. I point out that this leads\nto consideration of the normal stress difference between the hoop stress and\nthe radial stress, in preference to a focus on just the hoop stress itself.\nAdditionally, I argue that simulations of thick accretion flows and collapsars\nare not self-consistent if they include a phenomenological model for an\nMRI-induced viscous stress but disregard these other MRI-induced stress\ncomponents. I comment briefly on the RHESSI observation of polarization in the\ngamma-ray burst GRB0212206.

This paper\nfills this gap and presents 3D numerical simulations of the evolution of\nlocally isothermal, massive and magnetized disks. In the absence of magnetic\nfields, a laminar disk fragments and clumps are formed due to the effect of\nself--gravity. Although they disapear in less than a dynamical timescale in the\nsimulations because of the limited numerical resolution, various diagnostics\nsuggest that they should survive and form giant planets in real disks. When the\ndisk is magnetized, it becomes turbulent at the same time as gravitational\ninstabilities develop. At intermediate resolution, no fragmentation is observed\nin these turbulent models, while a large number of fragments appear in the\nequivalent hydrodynamical runs. This is because MHD turbulence reduces the\nstrength of the gravitational instability. As the resolution is increased, the\nmost unstable wavelengths of the MRI are better resolved and small scale\nangular momentum transport starts to play a role: fragments are found to form\nin massive and turbulent disks in that case.

Groupoids\ngeneralize groups, spaces, group actions, and equivalence relations. This last\naspect dominates in noncommutative geometry, where groupoids provide the basic\ntool to desingularize pathological quotient spaces. In physics, however, the\nmain role of groupoids is to provide a unified description of internal and\nexternal symmetries. What is shared by noncommutative geometry and physics is\nthe importance of Connes's idea of associating a C*-algebra C*(G) to a Lie\ngroupoid G: in noncommutative geometry C*(G) replaces a given singular quotient\nspace by an appropriate noncommutative space, whereas in physics it gives the\nalgebra of observables of a quantum system whose symmetries are encoded by G.\nMoreover, Connes's map G -> C*(G) has a classical analogue G -> A*(G) in\nsymplectic geometry due to Weinstein, which defines the Poisson manifold of the\ncorresponding classical system as the dual of the so-called Lie algebroid A(G)\nof the Lie groupoid G, an object generalizing both Lie algebras and tangent\nbundles. This will also lead into symplectic groupoids and the conjectural\nfunctoriality of quantization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2005 13:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Our discussion of this relationship is partly\nhistorical and conceptual, but mostly technical and mathematically rigorous,\nincluding over 500 references. On the assumption that quantum mechanics is\nuniversal and complete, we discuss three ways in which classical physics has so\nfar been believed to emerge from quantum physics, namely in the limit h -> 0 of\nsmall Planck's constant (in a finite system), in the limit of a large system,\nand through decoherence and consistent histores. The first limit is closely\nrelated to modern quantization theory and microlocal analysis, whereas the\nsecond involves methods of C*-algebras and the concepts of superselection\nsectors and macroscopic observables. In these limits, the classical world does\nnot emerge as a sharply defined objective reality, but rather as an approximate\nappearance relative to certain \"classical\" states and observables. Decoherence\nsubsequently clarifies the role of such states, in that they are \"einselected\",\ni.e. robust against coupling to the environment. Furthermore, the nature of\nclassical observables is elucidated by the fact that they typically define\n(approximately) consistent sets of histories. We make the point that\nclassicality results from the elimination of certain states and observables\nfrom quantum theory.
