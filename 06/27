Although it is generally believed that these galaxies\nhost intense star-formation activity, there is growing evidence that a\nsubstantial fraction also harbor an AGN. We present here possibly the strongest\nevidence for this viewpoint to date: the combination of ultra-deep X-ray\nobservations (the 2 Ms CDF-N) and deep Keck spectroscopic data. We find that\nthe majority (~75%) of the spectroscopically identified SMGs host AGN activity;\nthe other ~25% have X-ray properties consistent with star formation (X-ray\nderived SFRs of ~1300-2700 solars/yr). The AGNs have properties generally\nconsistent with those of nearby luminous AGNs (L_X~1E43-3E44) and the majority\n(~80%) are heavily obscured. We construct composite rest-frame 2-20 keV spectra\nfor three different obscuration classes. An ~1 keV equivalent width FeK-alpha\nemission line is seen in the composite X-ray spectrum of the most heavily\nobscured AGNs (N_H>5x10^{23}), suggesting Compton-thick or near Compton-thick\nabsorption. Even taking into account the effects of absorption, we find that\nthe average X-ray-FIR ratio of the AGN-classified SMGs is approximately one\norder of magnitude below that found for typical quasars. This result suggests\nthat intense star-formation activity dominates the bolometric output; however,\nwe also explore whether the X-ray-FIR ratio is intrinsically less than that\nfound for typical quasars and postulate that some SMGs may be AGN dominated. We\ninvestigate the growth of massive black holes, discuss prospects for deeper\nobservations, and explore the potential of the next generation of X-ray\nobservatories.

We consider the cases that the system is near the half-filling, which are\nsimilar situations to high-$T_c$ cuprates.

Such functions are\nalternatively characterized as those having a linear-fractional presentation\nwhich identifies them as transfer functions of a certain type of conservative\nstructured multidimensional linear system. There now has been introduced a\nnoncommutative version of the Schur-Agler class which consists of formal power\nseries in noncommuting indeterminants satisfying a noncommutative version of\nthe von Neumann inequality when a tuple of operators (not necessarily\ncommuting) coming from a noncommutative operator ball are plugged in for the\nformal indeterminants. Formal power series in this noncommutative Schur-Agler\nclass in turn are characterized as those having a certain linear-fractional\npresentation in noncommuting variables identifying them as transfer functions\nof a recently introduced class of conservative structure multidimensional\nlinear systems having evolution along a free semigroup rather than along an\ninteger lattice. The purpose of this paper is to extend the previously\ndeveloped interpolation theory for the commutative Schur-Agler class to this\nnoncommutative setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2005 23:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
