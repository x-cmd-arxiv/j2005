We consider space-based, balloon-borne and ground-based\nexperiments. We find that foreground contamination and residuals from\nforeground subtraction are ultimately the limiting factors in detecting a\nprimordial gravity wave signal. For full-sky space-based experiments, these\nfactors hinder the detection of tensor-to-scalar ratios of r < 10^{-3} on large\nscales, while for ground-based experiments these factors impede the ability to\napply delensing techniques. We consider ground-based/balloon-borne experiments\nof currently planned or proposed designs and find that it is possible for a\nvalue of r=0.01 to be measured at ~ 3-sigma level. A small space-based CMB\npolarization experiment, with current detector technology and full sky\ncoverage, can detect r ~ 10^{-3} at the ~ 3-sigma level, but a markedly\nimproved knowledge of polarized foregrounds is needed. We advocate using as\nwide a frequency coverage as possible in order to carry out foreground\nsubtraction at the percent level, which is necessary to measure such a small\nprimordial tensor amplitude. To produce a clearly detectable (>3-sigma) tensor\ncomponent in a realistic CMB experiment, inflation must either involve\nlarge-field variations, \\Delta\\phi >~ 1 or multi-field/hybrid models. Hybrid\nmodels can be easily distinguished from large-field models due to their blue\nscalar spectral index. Therefore, an observation of a tensor/scalar ratio and n\n< 1 in future experiments with the characteristics considered here may be an\nindication that inflation is being driven by some physics in which the inflaton\ncannot be described as a fundamental field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2005 18:57:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2005 13:14:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2006 21:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-12"}

The onset of superconductivity is accompanied by a\nsteep increase in the thermal Hall angle, pointing to a striking enhancement in\nthe quasiparticle mean free path. This enhancement is drastically suppressed in\na very weak magnetic field. These results highlight that CeCoIn_5 is unique\namong superconductors. A small Fermi energy, a large superconducting gap, a\nshort coherence length, and a long mean free path all indicate that CeCoIn_5 is\nclearly in the superclean regime (E_F/Delta<<l/xi), in which peculiar vortex\nstate is expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2005 07:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The method is based on the visibility of the speckle\npattern formed by the scattered light as detected by a single exposure of a\ndigital camera. Whereas previous multispeckle methods rely on correlations\nbetween images, here the connection with scattering site dynamics is made more\nsimply in terms of the variance of intensity among the pixels of the camera for\nthe specified exposure duration. The essence is that the speckle pattern is\nmore visible, i.e. the variance of detected intensity levels is greater, when\nthe dynamics of the scattering site motion is slow compared to the exposure\ntime of the camera. The theory for analyzing the moments of the spatial\nintensity distribution in terms of the electric field autocorrelation is\npresented. It is demonstrated for two well-understood samples, a colloidal\nsuspension of Brownian particles and a coarsening foam, where the dynamics can\nbe treated as stationary. However, the method is particularly appropriate for\nsamples in which the dynamics vary with time, either slowly or rapidly, limited\nonly by the exposure time fidelity of the camera.

Using several sequenced yeast genomes,\nglobal expression and protein abundance data, and sets of paralogs traceable to\nan ancient whole-genome duplication in yeast, we rule out several confounding\neffects and show that expression level explains roughly half the variation in\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae protein evolutionary rates. We examine causes for\nexpression's dominant role and find that genome-wide tests favor the\ntranslational robustness explanation over existing hypotheses that invoke\nconstraints on function or translational efficiency. Our results suggest that\nproteins evolve at rates largely unrelated to their functions, and can explain\nwhy highly expressed proteins evolve slowly across the tree of life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2005 17:20:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2005 04:32:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Recently this notion has led to a more general\nnotion of quantum error correction known as operator quantum error correction.\nIn standard quantum error correcting codes, one requires the ability to apply a\nprocedure which exactly reverses on the error correcting subspace any\ncorrectable error. In contrast, for operator error correcting subsystems, the\ncorrection procedure need not undo the error which has occurred, but instead\none must perform correction only modulo the subsystem structure. This does not\nlead to codes which differ from subspace codes, but does lead to recovery\nroutines which explicitly make use of the subsystem structure. Here we present\ntwo examples of such operator error correcting subsystems. These examples are\nmotivated by simple spatially local Hamiltonians on square and cubic lattices.\nIn three dimensions we provide evidence, in the form a simple mean field\ntheory, that our Hamiltonian gives rise to a system which is self-correcting.\nSuch a system will be a natural high-temperature quantum memory, robust to\nnoise without external intervening quantum error correction procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2005 18:45:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2005 23:37:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2005 16:58:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2005 00:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-22"}

For example, in the classical\nrepresentation theory of SU(1,1), unitary representations are infinite\ndimensional from the starting point. Therefore, to develop a unitary theory of\nnon-commutative system of SU(1,1) we need an infinite number of non-commutative\nsystems, which means a kind of {\\bf second non-commutativization}.
