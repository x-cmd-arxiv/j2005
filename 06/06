We first discuss\nasymptotics when the initial size of the population tends to infinity. In that\nsetting, under appropriate hypotheses, we show that a rescaled version of the\ngeneralized Fleming-Viot process converges weakly to a continuous-state\nbranching process. As a corollary, we get a hydrodynamic limit for certain\nsequences of coalescents with multiple collisions: Under an appropriate\nscaling, the empirical measure associated with sizes of the blocks converges to\na (deterministic) limit which solves a generalized form of Smoluchowski's\ncoagulation equation.

This model has lead to the resolution of a number of\nlongstanding problems, including a dynamical explanation for the so-called\n`dark matter' effect. It has also given the first evidence of quantum gravity\neffects, as experimental data has shown that a new dimensionless constant\ncharacterising the self-interaction of space is the fine structure constant.\nThe studies here begin the task of examining to what extent the new spatial\nself-interaction dynamics can play a role in stabilising the boundary without\nexotic matter, and whether the boundary stabilisation dynamics can be\nengineered; this would amount to quantum gravity engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2005 06:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-24"}
