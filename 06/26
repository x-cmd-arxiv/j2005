Physical Review B71, accepted","journal-ref":null,"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevB.71.214306","report-no":null,"categories":"nlin.PS","license":null,"abstract":"  Intrinsic localized modes (ILMs) in a quasi-1D antiferromagnetic material\n(C2H5NH3)2CuCl4 are counted by using a novel nonlinear energy magnetometer. The\nILMs are produced by driving the uniform spin wave mode unstable with an\nintense microwave pulse. Subsequently a subset of these ILMs become captured by\nand locked to a cw driver so that their properties can be examined at a later\ntime with a tunable cw low power probe source. Four wave mixing is used to\nenhance the emission signal from the few large amplitude ILMs over that\nassociated with the many small amplitude plane wave modes. A discrete step\nstructure observed in the emission signal is identified with individual ILMs\nbecoming unlocked from the driver. At most driver power and frequency settings\nthe resulting emission step structure appears uniformly distributed; however,\nsometimes, nearby in parameter space, families of emission steps are evident as\nthe driver frequency or power is varied. Two different experimental methods\ngive consistent results for counting individual ILMs. Because of the\ndiscreteness in the emission both the size of an ILM and its energy can be\nestimated from these experiments. For the uniformly distributed case each ILM\nextends over ~42 antiferromagnetic unit cells and has an energy value of\n1.3x10^-12 [J] while for the case with families the ILM length becomes ~54\nantiferromagnetic unit cells with an energy of 1.5x10^-12 [J]. An unresolved\npuzzle is that the emission step height does not depend on experimental\nparameters the way classical numerical simulations suggest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2005 02:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
