We use the data to probe numerous properties of the pulsar, most notably\nits shape, and the dependence of its spindown torque on the angle between its\nspin and magnetic axes, for which we assume a sum of a spin-aligned component\n(with a weight 1-a) and a dipolar component perpendicular to the magnetic beam\naxis (weight a), rather than the vacuum dipole torque (a=1). We find that a\nvariety of shapes are consistent with the residuals, with a slight statistical\npreference for a prolate star. Moreover, a range of torque possibilities fit\nthe data equally well, with no strong preference for the vacuum model. In the\ncase of a prolate star we find evidence for an angle-dependent spindown torque.\nOur results show that the combination of geometrical and spin-down effects\nassociated with precession can account for the principal features of PSR\nB1828-11's timing behavior, without fine tuning of the parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2005 18:59:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2005 02:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

Comparing echelle spectra of the NaI D absorption lines with the\nliterature, we show that one system disappeared in 2000 only to reappear in\nlater epochs. Notably, we detect a large decrease in polarization across the\nentire optical spectrum of Mrk 231 from 1995 to 2003. Though the polarization\nfraction fell, e.g., from 4% to 3% at about 6000 Angstroms, the polarization\nposition angle spectrum remained unchanged. The optical polarization behavior\nis consistent with a decrease in the flux scattered by circumnuclear material\non spatial scales where the broad-line region is resolved by the scattering\nmaterial. Ultraviolet imaging polarimetry of Mrk 231 by HST sets an upper limit\non the distance between the active nucleus and the scattering regions of <20\npc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2005 00:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Far larger particle numbers (~ 10^8)\nare required for the RMS perturbations to the velocity to drop to the 10 %\nlevel there. The radial scaling of the relaxation time is simple and strong:\nt_relax ~ r^2, implying that numbers >> 10^8 are required to faithfully model\nthe very inner regions; artificial relaxation may thus constitute an important\nfactor, contributing to the contradictory claims concerning the persistence of\na power law density cusp to the very centre. The cores of substructure haloes\ncan be many relaxation times old. Since relaxation first causes their expansion\nbefore recontraction occurs, it may render them either more difficult or easier\nto disrupt, depending on their orbital parameters. It may thus modify the\ncharacteristics of the subhalo distribution and effects of interactions with\nthe parent. We derive simple closed form formulas for the characteristic\nrelaxation times, as well as for the weak N-scaling reported by Diemand et al.\nwhen the main contribution comes from relaxing subhaloes (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2005 00:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

A dimensionless equilibrium\nconfiguration is specified by a single parameter regardless of particle\nproperties, the Fermi velocity at the center, and the scalings of mass and\nlength are specified by the rest mass and statistical weight of the dark matter\nparticle.

N03 showed that the produced dust species depends strongly on the\nmixing within SNe. We treated both unmixed and mixed cases and calculated the\ninfrared (IR) spectral energy distribution (SED) of forming galaxies for both\ncases. Our model SED is less luminous than the SED of T03 model by a factor of\n2-3. The difference is due to our improved treatment of UV photon absorption\ncross section, as well as different grain size and species newly adopted in\nthis work. The SED for the unmixed case is found to have an enhanced near to\nmid-IR (N-MIR) continuum radiation in its early phase of the evolution (age <\n10^{7.25} yr) compared with that for the mixed case. The strong N--MIR\ncontinuum is due to the emission from Si grains, which only exist in the\nspecies of the unmixed dust production. We also calculated the IR extinction\ncurves for forming galaxies. Then we calculated the SED of a local starbursting\ndwarf galaxy SBS 0335-052.

It is shown that such systems are\ncontrollable, provided that the conserved quantity is a proper function. The\nproof of the result combines analytic tools with probabilistic arguments. While\nthis statement is well-known in geometric control theory, the probabilistic\nproof given in this note seems to be new. We show that controllability follows\nfrom H\\\"ormander's condition, together with the a priori knowledge of an\ninvariant measure with full topological support for a diffusion that\n`implements' the control system.\n  Examples are given that illustrate the relevance of the assumptions required\nfor the result to hold.

These assumptions are: fast gates, a constant supply of fresh\nand cold ancillas, and a Markovian bath. We point out that these assumptions\nmay not be mutually consistent in light of rigorous formulations of the\nMarkovian approximation. Namely, Markovian dynamics requires either the\nsingular coupling limit (high temperature), or the weak coupling limit (weak\nsystem-bath interaction). The former is incompatible with the assumption of a\nconstant and fresh supply of cold ancillas, while the latter is inconsistent\nwith fast gates. We discuss ways to resolve these inconsistencies. As part of\nour discussion we derive, in the weak coupling limit, a new master equation for\na system subject to periodic driving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2005 17:31:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2006 21:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
