We show that at the rotation rates relevant to the\nmagneto-rotational instability, the flow is strongly constrained by the\nTaylor-Proudman theorem. As a result, it is controlled almost entirely by the\nend-plates. We then consider two possible options for minimizing these\nend-effects, namely (i) simply taking a very long cylinder, and (ii) splitting\nthe end-plates into a series of differentially rotating rings. Regarding option\n(i), we show that the cylinder would have to be hundreds of times as long as it\nis wide before end-effects become unimportant in the interior. Since this is\nclearly not feasible, we turn to option (ii), and show that in order to obtain\na smooth angular velocity profile, the end-plates would have to be split into\naround ten rings. If the end-plates are split into fewer rings, perhaps 3-5,\nthe angular velocity profile will not be smooth, but will instead consist of a\nseries of Stewartson layers at the boundaries from one ring to the next. We\nsuggest therefore that the instabilities one obtains in this system will be the\nfamiliar Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities of these Stewartson layers, rather than\nthe magneto-rotational instability. At best, one might hope to obtain the MRI\nsuperimposed on these Kelvin-Helmholtz modes. Any subsequent interpretation of\nresults is thus likely to be quite complicated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2005 16:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-13"}

The Chandra spectrum is consistent with the\npresence of a relativistically broadened, highly redshifted iron K alpha\nemission line with a similar profile to previous observations. A number of\nnarrow features are detected above 2 keV, including a narrow Fe K alpha\nemission line and narrow absorption lines from H- and He-like Fe, H-like S and\nH-like Si. This absorption is well described by a photoionized plasma with a\ncolumn density log N_H = 23.2 and an ionization parameter log xi = 3.6,\nassuming the iron abundance has the Solar value and a velocity dispersion\nparameter b = 100 km/s. Applying this absorption model to a high fidelity\nXMM-Newton EPIC-pn spectrum we find that a broad iron line is still required\nwith emission extending to within 1.9 gravitational radii of the black hole.

The H- and\nHe-like iron absorption lines in the Chandra spectrum are blueshifted by 2.0\n(+0.7/-0.9) x 10^3 km/s compared to the source frame, and may originate in a\nhigh velocity, high ionization component of the warm absorber outflow. This\nhigh ionization component may dominate the energy budget of the outflow, and\naccount for a significant fraction of the outflowing mass.

The model is compared to measured LFs out to a\nredshift of 3.5, including LFs of galaxy types separated to red and blue\ngalaxies. The increase in the number density of luminous galaxies, at the\nbright-end of the LF, can be explained as due to a brightening of the\nluminosity of galaxies present in dark matter halo centers, relative to the\nluminosity of central galaxies in similar mass halos today. The lack of strong\nevolution in the faint-end of the LF, however, argues against a model involving\npure luminosity evolution at all halo mass scales. The increase in luminosity\nat the bright-end compensates the rapid decline in the number density of\nmassive halos as the redshift is increased. The decline in group to\ncluster-mass dark matter halos out to a redshift of ~ 2 is not important as the\ncentral galaxy luminosity flattens at halo masses around 10^13 M_sun At\nredshifts ~ 2 to 3, however, the density of bright galaxies begins to decrease\ndue to the rapid decline in the number density of dark matter halos at mass\nscales around and below 10^13 M_sun.

The measurements were made at Rayleigh numbers R up to 10^11 with two\nsamples of height L equal to the diameter D (aspect ratio Gamma = D/L = 1). The\nfluid was water with a Prandtl number sigma = 4.38. In contrast to the\nexperiences reported by Chilla et. al. (2004) for a similar sample but with\nGamma = 0.5 (D = 0.5 and L = 1.0 m), we found no long relaxation times. For R =\n9.4 times 10^10 we measured the Nusselt number N as a function of tilt angle\nbeta and obtained a small beta dependence about a factor of 50 smaller than the\nresult found by Chilla et. al. (2004) for their Gamma = 0.5 sample. We measured\nside-wall temperatures at eight equally spaced azimuthal locations on the\nhorizontal mid-plane of the sample and used their cross-correlation functions\nto find the turn-over time of the large-scale circulation (LSC). The resulting\nReynolds numbers R_e^cc were found to increase with beta. An important\nconclusion is that the increase of R_e^cc with beta of the LSC does not\nsignificantly influence the heat transport. Over the range 10^9 < R < 10^11 the\nenhancement of R_e^cc at constant beta due to the tilt could be described by a\npower law of R with an exponent of -1/6, consistent with a simple model that\nbalances the additional buoyancy due to the tilt angle by the shear stress\nacross the boundary layers. Even a small tilt angle dramatically suppressed the\nazimuthal meandering and the sudden reorientations characteristic of the LSC in\na sample with beta = 0.
