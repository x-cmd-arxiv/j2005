This distribution\nleads to a probability distribution function of speed v along z varying\napproximately as f(v) scaling as (1/v) exp(-v/vo); hence it diverges as 1/v at\nsmall speed and it is quite non Boltzmannian at large speed. Here, a model is\nproposed, which explains these experimental impact distributions; it takes\naccount of the true role of the boundaries and of the dissipation in the gas.\nThis validates the experimental data. Different approximations are discussed.\nRoles of boundaries and of 0-g condition are investigated theoretically.

The latest, also called Carnot-Caratheodory or subriemannian\ndistance, is by definition the length of the shortest horizontal path between\npoints, that is to say the shortest path whose tangent vector is everywhere\nhorizontal with respect to the gauge connection. In noncommutative geometry all\nthe metric information is encoded within the Dirac operator D. In the classical\ncase, i.e. commutative, Connes's distance formula allows to extract from D the\ngeodesic distance on a riemannian spin manifold.

It was expected that the noncommutative geometry\ndistance d defined by a covariant Dirac operator was intimately linked to the\nCarnot-Caratheodory distance dh defined by A. In this paper we precise this\nlink, showing that the equality of d and dh strongly depends on the holonomy of\nthe connection. Quite interestingly we exhibit an elementary example, based on\na 2 torus, in which the noncommutative distance has a very simple expression\nand simultaneously avoids the main drawbacks of the riemannian metric (no\ndiscontinuity of the derivative of the distance function at the cut-locus) and\nof the subriemannian one (memory of the structure of the fiber).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2005 15:27:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2006 12:15:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2006 11:00:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 18 Mar 2007 23:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-24"}

We use molecular dynamics and other\ncomputational tools to explore the time-dependent behavior of conformational\nstates of a C-terminus of tubulin within a microtubule and assume that each\nC-terminus interacts via screened Coulomb forces with the surface of a tubulin\ndimer, with neighboring C-termini and also with any adjacent\nmicrotubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). Each C-terminus can either bind to the\ntubulin surface via one of several positively charged regions or can be allowed\nto explore the space available in the solution surrounding the dimer. We find\nthat the preferential orientation of each C-terminus is away from the tubulin\nsurface but binding to the surface may also take place, albeit at a lower\nprobability. The results of our model suggest that perturbations generated by\nthe C-termini interactions with counter-ions surrounding a MAP2 may propagate\nover distances greater than those between adjacent microtubules. Thus, the MAP2\nstructure is able to act as a kind of biological wire (or a cable) transmitting\nlocal electrostatic perturbations resulting in ionic concentration gradients\nfrom one microtubule to another. We briefly discuss implications the current\ndynamic modeling may have on synaptic activation and potentiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2005 00:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For perfectly periodic sequences, early\nbulk experiments of Poerschke indicate the existence of a sliding process,\npermitting the rapid transition between different relative strand positions\n[Biophys. Chem. 2 (1974) 83]. Here, we use a detailed theoretical model to\nstudy the basepairing dynamics of periodic and nearly periodic DNA. As\nsuggested by Poerschke, DNA sliding is mediated by basepairing defects (bulge\nloops), which can diffuse along the DNA. Moreover, a shear force f on opposite\nends of the two strands yields a characteristic dynamic response: An outward\naverage sliding velocity v~1/N is induced in a double strand of length N,\nprovided f is larger than a threshold f_c. Conversely, if the strands are\ninitially misaligned, they realign even against an external force less than\nf_c. These dynamics effectively result in a viscoelastic behavior of DNA under\nshear forces, with properties that are programmable through the choice of the\nDNA sequence. We find that a small number of mutations in periodic sequences\ndoes not prevent DNA sliding, but introduces a time delay in the dynamic\nresponse. We clarify the mechanism for the time delay and describe it\nquantitatively within a phenomenological model. Based on our findings, we\nsuggest new dynamical roles for DNA in artificial nanoscale devices. The\nbasepairing dynamics described here is also relevant for the extension of\nrepetitive sequences inside genomic DNA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2005 11:59:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2005 13:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It expresses fidelity as an\ninterference sum of dephasing trajectories weighed by the Wigner function of\nthe initial state, and does not require that the initial state be localized in\nposition or momentum. This general dephasing representation is special in that,\ncounterintuitively, all of fidelity decay is due to dephasing and none due to\nthe decay of classical overlaps. Surprising accuracy of the approximation is\njustified by invoking the shadowing theorem: twice--both for physical\nperturbations and for numerical errors. It is shown how the general expression\nreduces to the special forms for position and momentum states and for wave\npackets localized in position or momentum. The superiority of the general over\nthe specialized forms is explained and supported by numerical tests for wave\npackets, non-local pure states, and for simple and random mixed states. The\ntests are done in non-universal regimes in mixed phase space where detailed\nfeatures of fidelity are important. Although semiclassically motivated, present\napproach is valid for abstract systems with a finite Hilbert basis provided\nthat the discrete Wigner transform is used.
