Assuming that a second continuous phase\ntransition occurs, we classify the possibilities. We construct the symmetry\ngroup of the first ordered phase, and then re-classify the order parameters in\nthe new symmetry. While this is straightforward for dipole or quadrupole order,\nit is less familiar for octupole order. We give a group theoretical analysis,\nand some illustrative mean field calculations, for the hypothetical case when a\nsecond ordering transition modifies the primary T(xyz) octupolar ordering in a\ntetragonal system like URu2Si2.

For O(xy), O(zx), or O(yz) quadrupoles, this would be\none of the components of J, which should be easy either to check or to rule\nout. However, a pre-existing octupolar symmetry can also be broken by a\ntransition to a new octupole--hexadecapole order, or by a combination of O(22)\nquadrupole and triakontadipole order. It is interesting to notice that if\nrecent NQR results (Saitoh et al, 2005) on URu2Si2 are interpreted as a hint\nthat the onset of octupolar hidden order at T0=17K is followed by quadrupolar\nordering at T* = 13.5K, this sequence of events may fit several of the\nscenarios found in our general classification scheme.

Recalling Anderson's proscription of\n\"irrelevant\" variables, I generalize that proscription to locally irrelevant\nvariables that do no work in some places in some models. This move vindicates\nFriedman's intuitions and removes the Jones-Geroch counterexample: some regions\nof some models of gravity with dust are dust-free and so naturally lack a\ntimelike 4-velocity, so diffeomorphic equivalence to (1,0,0,0) is spoiled.\nTorretti's example involving constant curvature spaces is shown to have an\nabsolute object on Anderson's analysis, viz., the conformal spatial metric\ndensity. The previously neglected threat of an absolute object from an\northonormal tetrad used for coupling spinors to gravity appears resolvable by\neliminating irrelevant fields. However, given Anderson's definition, GTR itself\nhas an absolute object (as Robert Geroch has observed recently): a change of\nvariables to a conformal metric density and a scalar density shows that the\nlatter is absolute.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2005 15:30:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2005 13:24:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2006 16:59:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2006 02:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-21"}

This metric\nis intrinsically defined and definite but only if indefinite metrics are\nintroduced it is possible to fully understand the structure of pseudospheres.\nIn a 3D flat space R^3 the fundamental quadric is introduced, with the same\nsignature as the metric of R^3; this leads to 3 kinds of surfaces with constant\nGaussian curvature: the sphere, the single-sheet hyperboloid and the two-sheet\nhyperboloid; the last one is shown to be isomorphic to Beltrami's disk.

Their theory explains the stability of\nattractive system H(2) with a repulsive Hamiltonian instead of with the\nattractive one, representative for charge-asymmetrical system HHbar. A new\nsecond order symmetry effect is detected. Repulsive HL Hamiltonian H(+) applies\nat long range but at the critical distance, attractive charge-inverted\nHamiltonian H(-)takes over and leads to bond H(2) but in reality, HHbar, for\nwhich we give an analytical proof. Another wrong asymptote choice in the past\nalso applies for atomic antihydrogen Hbar, which has hidden the Mexican hat\npotential for natural hydrogen. This generic solution removes most problems,\nphysicists and chemists experience with atomic Hbar and molecular HHbar,\nincluding the problem with antimatter in the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2005 12:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We have\nused optical spectroscopy to follow the oxidative polymerization of DHICA to\neumelanin, and observe red shifting and broadening of the absorption spectrum\nas the reaction proceeds. First principles density functional theory\ncalculations indicate that DHICA oligomers (possible reaction products of\noxidative polymerization) have red shifted HOMO-LUMO gaps with respect to the\nmonomer. Furthermore, different bonding configurations (leading to oligomers\nwith different structures) produce a range of gaps. These experimental and\ntheoretical results lend support to the chemical disorder model where the broad\nband monotonic absorption characteristic of all melanins is a consequence of\nthe superposition of a large number of inhomogeneously broadened Gaussian\ntransitions associated with each of the components of a melanin ensemble. These\nresults suggest that the traditional model of eumelanin as an amorphous organic\nsemiconductor is not required to explain its optical properties, and should be\nthoroughly re-examined. These results have significant implications for our\nunderstanding of the physics, chemistry and biological function of these\nimportant biological macromolecules. Indeed, one may speculate that the robust\nfunctionality of melanins in vitro is a direct consequence of its\nheterogeneity, i.e. chemical disorder is a \"low cost\" natural resource in these\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2005 04:25:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2005 05:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
