In particular, we\nconsider inelastic one- and two-phonon scattering between different exciton\nstates (energy-relaxation-induced dephasing), as well as elastic two-phonon\nscattering of the excitons (pure dephasing). The exciton states follow from\nnumerical diagonalization of a Frenkel Hamiltonian with diagonal disorder; the\nscattering rates between them are obtained using the Fermi Golden Rule. A\nDebye-like model for the one- and two-phonon spectral densities is used in the\ncalculations. We find that, owing to the disorder, the dephasing rates of the\nindividual exciton states are distributed over a wide range of values. We also\ndemonstrate that the dominant channel of two-phonon scattering is not the\nelastic one, as is often tacitly assumed, but rather comes from a similar\ntwo-phonon inelastic scattering process. In order to study the temperature\ndependence of the J-band width, we simulate the absorption spectrum, accounting\nfor the dephasing induced broadening of the exciton states. We find a power-law\n(T^p) temperature scaling of the effective homogeneous width, with an exponent\np that depends on the shape of the spectral density of host vibrations.

These methods seem particularly useful to the study of chaos since\nno analytical chaotic solution is currently available. Using the well-known\nLorenz equations as an example, it is demonstrated that numerically computed\nresults and their associated statistical properties are time-step dependent.\nThere are two reasons for this behavior. First, chaotic differential equations\nare unstable so that any small error is amplified exponentially near an\nunstable manifold. The more serious and lesser-known reason is that stable and\nunstable manifolds of singular points associated with differential equations\ncan form virtual separatrices. The existence of a virtual separatrix presents\nthe possibility of a computed trajectory actually jumping through it due to the\nfinite time-steps of discrete numerical methods. Such behavior violates the\nuniqueness theory of differential equations and amplifies the numerical errors\nexplosively. These reasons imply that, even if computed results are bounded,\ntheir independence on time-step should be established before accepting them as\nuseful numerical approximations to the true solution of the differential\nequations. However, due to these exponential and explosive amplifications of\nnumerical errors, no computed chaotic solutions of differential equations\nindependent of integration-time step have been found.

Three-proper time models\nare built for spinless particle, particles with integer spin and half-integer\nspin respectively. The models recreate the same physical behavior as quantum\nfield theory of free particles -- by using pure classical methods with three\nproper time. A new interpretation of spin is given. It provides us more evident\nthat it is possible to interpret quantum physics by using multiple dimensional\ntime.

Although not yet achieved\nwithin the framework of standard quantum theory, it has been achieved within\nthe framework of the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) wave function\ncollapse model. In this paper, I consider a previously presented model, which\nis predictively equivalent to CSL. In this Completely Quantized Collapse (CQC)\nmodel, the classical random field which causes collapse in CSL is quantized.\nThe ensemble of realizable states is described by a single state vector, the\n\"ensemble vector,\" the sum of the direct product of an eigenstate of the\nquantized field and the CSL state corresponding to that eigenstate. Using this\ndescription, a long standing problem is resolved: it is shown how to define\nenergy of the random field and its energy of interaction with particles so that\ntotal energy is conserved for the ensemble of realizable states. As a\nbyproduct, since the random field energy spectrum is unbounded, its canonical\nconjugate, a self-adjoint time operator, is discussed. Finally, CSL is a\nphenomenological description, whose connection to, or derivation from, more\nconventional physics has not yet appeared. We suggest that, because CQC is\nfully quantized, it is a natural framework for replacement of the classical\nfield of CSL by a quantized physical entity. Two illustrative examples are\ngiven.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2005 20:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

An idea which has proven very useful is that of the {\\it\nentanglement monotone}: a function of the state which is invariant under local\nunitary transformations and always decreases (or increases) on average after\nany local operation. In this paper we look on LOCC as the set of operations\ngenerated by {\\it infinitesimal local operations}, operations which can be\nperformed locally and which leave the state little changed. We show that a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for a function of the state to be an\nentanglement monotone under local operations that do not involve information\nloss is that the function be a monotone under infinitesimal local operations.\nWe then derive necessary and sufficient differential conditions for a function\nof the state to be an entanglement monotone. We first derive two conditions for\nlocal operations without information loss, and then show that they can be\nextended to more general operations by adding the requirement of {\\it\nconvexity}. We then demonstrate that a number of known entanglement monotones\nsatisfy these differential criteria. Finally, as an application, we use the\ndifferential conditions to construct a new polynomial entanglement monotone for\nthree-qubit pure states.
