A\ncomparison of SDSS and PG photometry of both stars and quasars reveals the need\nto apply a color and magnitude recalibration to the PG data. Using the SDSS\nphotometric catalog, we define the PG's parent sample of objects that are not\nmain-sequence stars and simulate the selection of objects from this parent\nsample using the PG photometric criteria and errors. This simulation shows that\nthe effective U-B cut in the PG survey is U-B < -0.71 (rather than the intended\nU-B < -0.44), implying a color-related incompleteness. As the color\ndistribution of bright quasars peaks near U-B=-0.7 and the 2-sigma error in U-B\nis comparable to the full width of the color distribution of quasars, the color\nincompleteness of the BQS is approximately 50% and essentially random with\nrespect to U-B color for z<0.5. There is, however, a bias against bright\nquasars at 0.5 < z < 1, which is induced by the color-redshift relation of\nquasars (although quasars at z>0.5 are inherently rare in bright surveys in any\ncase). We find no evidence for any other systematic incompleteness when\ncomparing the distributions in color, redshift, and FIRST radio properties of\nthe BQS and a BQS-like subsample of the SDSS quasar sample.

The\neffort is based on the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) which provides\nvery sensitive and homogenous X-ray data on a uniquely large sample of 481\noptically well-characterized low-extinction low-mass members of the Orion\nNebula Cluster, for which individual stellar masses and ages could be\ndetermined. More than 98 percent of the stars in this sample are detected as\nX-ray sources. Within the PMS phase for stellar ages in the range $\\sim 0.1-10$\nMyr, we establish a mild decay in activity with stellar age $\\tau$ roughly as\n$L_{\\rm X} \\propto \\tau^{-1/3}$. On longer timescales, when the Orion stars are\ncompared to main sequence stars, the X-ray luminosity decay law for stars in\nthe $0.5 < M < 1.2$ M$_\\odot$ mass range is more rapid with $L_{\\rm X} \\propto\n\\tau^{-0.75}$ over the wide range of ages $5 < \\log \\tau < 9.5$ yr. The\nmagnetic activity history for M stars with masses $0.1 < M < 0.4 M_\\odot$ is\ndistinctly different. Only a mild decrease in X-ray luminosity, and even a mild\nincrease in $L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm bol}$ and $F_{\\rm X}$, is seen over the 1-100 Myr\nrange, though the X-ray emission does decay over long timescales on the main\nsequence. Together with COUP results on the absence of a rotation-activity\nrelation in Orion stars, we find that the activity-age decay is strong across\nthe entire history of solar-type stars but is not attributable to rotational\ndeceleration during the early epochs. A combination of tachocline and\ndistributed convective dynamos may be operative in young solar-type stars. The\nresults for the lowest mass stars are most easily understood by the dominance\nof convective dynamos during both the PMS and main sequence phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2005 10:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

B 52, 15319 (1995)],\nbased on the nonlinear sigma model. This strategy is valid in the weak\ninterchain (rung) coupling regime. We show that all frustrated tubes possess\nsix-fold degenerate spin-1 magnon bands, as the lowest excitations, while other\nladders and tubes have a standard triply degenerate bands. We also consider\neffects of four kinds of Zeeman terms: uniform, staggered only along the rung,\nonly along the chain, or both directions. The above prediction of the no-field\ncase implies that a sufficiently strong uniform field yields a two-component\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) due to the condensation of doubly degenerate\nlowest magnons in frustrated tubes. In contrast, the field induces a standard\none-component TLL in all other systems. This is supported by symmetry and\nbosonization arguments based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory. The bosonization\nalso suggests that the two-component TLL vanishes and a one-component TLL\nappears, when the uniform field becomes larger for the second lowest magnon\nbands to touch the zero-energy line. This transition could be observed as a\ncusp singularity in the magnetization process. All the analyses for the systems\nwith a staggered Zeeman term suggest that the emergence of the doubly\ndegenerate transverse magnons and the single longitudinal one is universal for\nthe one-dimensional AF spin systems with weak staggered field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2005 14:49:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2005 15:17:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2005 19:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

As a step toward this aim, we present\nhere a novel mesoscopic-level computational model that provides a new window\ninto nucleic acid dynamics. We model a single-stranded nucleic as a polymer\nchain whose monomers are the nucleosides. Each monomer comprises a bead\nrepresenting the sugar molecule and a pin representing the base. The bead-pin\ncomplex can rotate about the backbone of the chain. We consider pairwise\nstacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions. We use a modified Monte Carlo\ndynamics that splits the dynamics into translational bead motion and rotational\npin motion. By performing a number of tests we first show that our model is\nphysically sound. We then focus on the study of a the kinetics of a DNA\nhairpin--a single-stranded molecule comprising two complementary segments\njoined by a non-complementary loop--studied experimentally. We find that\nresults from our simulations agree with experimental observations,\ndemonstrating that our model is a suitable tool for the investigation of the\nhybridization of single strands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2005 23:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The Local Search\nproblem consists in finding a local minimum of the function f on G, that is a\nvertex v such that f(v) is not larger than the value of f on the neighbors of v\nin G. In this note, we first prove a separation theorem slightly stronger than\nthe one of Gilbert, Hutchinson and Tarjan for graphs of constant genus. This\nresult allows us to enhance a previously known deterministic algorithm for\nLocal Search with query complexity O(\\log n)\\cdot d+O(\\sqrt{g})\\cdot\\sqrt{n},\nso that we obtain a deterministic query complexity of\nd+O(\\sqrt{g})\\cdot\\sqrt{n}, where n is the size of G, d is its maximum degree,\nand $g$ is its genus.
