We find a\nlinear bias term that is consistent with unity, b_1 = 0.93^{+0.10}_{-0.08} and\na quadratic bias c_2 = b_2 /b_1 = -0.34^{+0.11}_{-0.08}. This is the first\nsignificant detection of a non-zero quadratic bias, indicating a small but\nimportant non-gravitational contribution to the three point function. Our\nestimate of the linear bias from the three point function is independent of the\nnormalisation of underlying density fluctuations, so we can combine this with\nthe measurement of the power spectrum of 2dFGRS galaxies to constrain the\namplitude of matter fluctuations.
