The key new notion behind this quantization scheme is the\nLagrange structure which is more general than the Lagrangian formalism in the\nsame sense as Poisson geometry is more general than the symplectic one. The\nLagrange structure is shown to admit a natural BRST description which is used\nto construct an AKSZ-type topological sigma-model. The dynamics of this\nsigma-model in $d+1$ dimensions, being localized on the boundary, are proved to\nbe equivalent to the original theory in $d$ dimensions. As the topological\nsigma-model has a well defined action, it is path-integral quantized in the\nusual way that results in quantization of the original (not necessarily\nLagrangian) theory. When the original equations of motion come from the action\nprinciple, the standard BV path-integral is explicitly deduced from the\nproposed quantization scheme. The general quantization scheme is exemplified by\nseveral models including the ones whose classical dynamics are not variational.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2005 16:54:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2005 09:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
