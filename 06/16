We study the sensitivity of this\nconclusion to different hydrodynamic assumptions on chemical and thermal\nfreezeout after the sQGP hadronizes. We show that if chemical freezeout occurs\nat the hadronization time, the differential elliptic flow for pions increase\nwith proper time in the late hadronic phase until thermal freezeout and leads\nto a discrepancy with the data. In contrast, if both chemical and thermal\nequilibrium are maintained past the hadronization, then the mean pT per pion\nincreases in a way that accidentally preserves v2(pT) from the sQGP phase in\nagreement with the data, but at the cost of the agreement with the hadronic\nyields. In order that all the data on hadronic ratios, radial flow, and\ndifferential elliptic flow be reproduced, the sQGP must expand with a minimal\nviscosity, \\eta_Q, that is however even greater than the viscosity, \\eta_H, of\nits hadronic corona. However, because of the large entropy density difference\nof the two phases of QCD matter, the larger viscosity in the sQGP phase leads\nto nearly perfect fluid flow while the smaller entropy density of the hadronic\ncorona strongly hinders the applicability of Euler hydrodynamics. The ``perfect\nfluid'' property of the sQGP is thus not due to a sudden reduction of the\nviscosity at the critical temperature Tc, but to a sudden increase of the\nentropy density of QCD matter and is therefore an important signature of\ndeconfinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2005 16:12:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2006 19:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Bag parameters for a\nfree $\\thetaplus$ are fixed to reproduce the observed mass of the $\\thetaplus$.\nIn doing so, we use three different values of the $s$-quark mass since the mass\nof the $s$-quark is not well known.

However, the coupling constant $g_\\sigma^s$\nbetween the $s$-quark and the $\\sigma$-meson cannot be fixed from the\nsaturation properties, and thus we treat $g_\\sigma^s$ as a free parameter and\ninvestigate how $\\mtheta^*$ depends on $g_\\sigma^s$. %$\\mtheta^*$ is calculated\nup to 2.5 times the nuclear saturation density, %and we find that We find that\n$\\mtheta^*$ depends significantly on the value of $g_\\sigma^s$ but not on the\nmass of the $s$-quark.
