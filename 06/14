When combined with the observed\nproperties of early-type SDSS galaxies, the observed intrinsic scatters imply\nthat SMBH growth is regulated by the spheroid velocity dispersion rather than\nits mass. The M_bh-M_sph relation is therefore a by-product of a more\nfundamental M_bh-sigma relation. We construct a theoretical model for the\nscatter among baryon modified dark matter halo profiles, out of which we\ngenerate a population of spheroid hosts and show that these naturally lead to a\nrelation between effective radius and velocity dispersion of the form R_sph ~\nsigma^1.5 with a scatter of ~0.2dex, in agreement with the corresponding\nprojection of the fundamental plane for early type galaxies in SDSS.

It is found that He+ and H3+ are enhanced and trigger a peculiar\nchemistry. Several molecular X-ray tracers are found and compared to tracers of\nthe far ultraviolet (FUV) field. Like ultraviolet radiation fields, X-rays\nenhance simple hydrides, ions and radicals. In contrast to ultraviolet photons,\nX-rays can penetrate deep into the envelope and affect the chemistry even at\nlarge distances from the source.

This model therefore\nfalls into a different category from glassy problems in which full\ntime-reparametrisation invariance, a larger symmetry that emcompasses time\nscale invariance, is expected to be realised asymptotically.

On the other hand, the diversity order achieved by antenna\nselection in spatial multiplexing systems, especially those exploiting\npractical coding and decoding schemes, has not been rigorously analyzed thus\nfar. In this paper, from a geometric standpoint, we propose a new framework for\ntheoretically analyzing the diversity order achieved by transmit antenna\nselection for separately encoded spatial multiplexing systems with linear and\ndecision-feedback receivers.

To this end, two parton inclusive cross sections\nfor arbitrary projectiles with small color charge density are derived in the\neikonal formalism. Our results are the following: For large momenta of the\nobserved particles, the perturbative limit with characteristic back-to-back\ncorrelation is recovered. As the trigger momenta get closer to the saturation\nscale Q_s, the angular distribution broadens. When the momenta are\nsignificantly smaller than Q_s, the azimuthal distribution is broad but still\npeaked back-to-back. However, in a narrow momentum range (0.5 - 1.5) Q_s, we\nobserve that the azimuthal correlation splits into a double peak with maxima\ndisplaced away from 180 degree. We argue that it is the soft multiple\nscattering physics that is responsible for the appearance of this shift in the\nangle of maximal correlation. We also point out that when the physical size of\nthe projectile is particularly small, the double peak structure persists in a\nsignificantly wider range of final state momenta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2005 18:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The method is\nparticularly well-suited to inspection of large, massive objects (since the\nincident gamma-ray probe is at 9.17 MeV) such as aviation and marine\ncontainers, heavy vehicles and railroad cars. Two kinds of gamma-ray detectors\nhave been employed to date in GRA systems: 1) Resonant-response nitrogen-rich\nliquid scintillators and 2) BGO detectors. This paper analyses and compares the\nresponse of these detector-types to the resonant radiation, in terms of\nsingle-pixel figures of merit. The latter are sensitive not only to detector\nresponse, but also to accelerator-beam quality, via the properties of the\nnuclear reaction that produces the resonant gamma-rays. Generally, resonant\ndetectors give rise to much higher nitrogen-contrast sensitivity in the\nradiographic image than their non-resonant detector counterparts and\nfurthermore, do not require proton beams of high energy-resolution. By\ncomparison, the non-resonant detectors have higher gamma-detection efficiency,\nbut their contrast sensitivity is very sensitive to the quality of the\naccelerator beam.

A quantum measurement\ninvolves the energy and matter exchange among not only the system being\nmeasured and the measuring apparatus but also the global environment of the\nuniverse resonant cavity, which together constrain the nature of the phase\ntransition. Strict realism, including strict energy and angular momentum\nconservation, is recovered in this view of the quantum measurement process\nbeyond the limit set by the uncertainty relations, which are themselves derived\nfrom the exact commutation relations for quantum conjugate variables.

It is\nalso shown that when $M$ is unknown but if we can estimate an upper bound of\npossible values of $M$, then an improvement in the time complexity of\nconventional Grover's algorithm is possible. In that case, the present scheme\nreduces the time complexity to $O(MlogN)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2005 11:27:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Specifically, we determine all achievable states\n$\\rho^{(0)}$ (average output of encryption) and for each particular set $P$ we\ndetermine the entropy of the key necessary and sufficient to encrypt this set.\nIt turns out that single bit of key is sufficient when the set $P$ is two\ndimensional. However, the necessary and sufficient entropy of the key in case\nof three dimensional $P$ varies continuously between 1 and 2 bits depending on\nthe state $\\rho^{(0)}$. Finally, we derive private quantum channels achieving\nthese bounds. We show that the impossibility of universal NOT operation on\nqubit can be derived from the fact that one bit of key is not sufficient to\nencrypt qubit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2005 13:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
