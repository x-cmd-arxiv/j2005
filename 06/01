Changing field configurations and laws of differential\nrotation parametrically, we compute 14 models and investigate effects of these\nparameters on the dynamics. In our models, we do not solve the neutrino\ntransport and instead employ a phenomenological parametric EOS that takes into\naccount the neutrino emissions. As a result of the calculations, we find that\nthe field configuration plays a significant role in the dynamics of the core if\nthe initial magnetic field is large enough. Models with initially concentrated\nfields produce more energetic explosions and more prolate shock waves than the\nuniform field. Quadrapole-like fields produce remarkably collimated and fast\njet, which might be important for gamma-ray bursts(GRB). The Lorentz forces\nexerted in the region where the plasma-beta is less than unity are responsible\nfor these dynamics. The pure toroidal field, on the other hand, does not lead\nto any explosion or matter ejection. This suggests the presupernova models of\nHeger et al.(2003), in which toroidal fields are predominant, is\ndisadvantageous for the magnetorotation-induced supernova considered here.\nModels with initially weak magnetic fields do not lead to explosion or matter\nejection, either. In these models magnetic fields play no role as they do not\ngrow on the timescale considered in this paper so that the magnetic pressure\ncould be comparable to the matter pressure. This is because the exponential\nfield growth as expected in MRI is not seen in our models. The magnetic field\nis amplified mainly by field-compression and field-wrapping in our simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2005 16:46:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2005 09:02:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2005 06:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In this picture\nthe frequency resolved spectrum equals the boundary layer spectrum, which\ntherefore can be straightforwardly determnined from the data. The obtained so\nboundary layer spectrum is well approximated by the saturated Comptonization\nmodel, its high energy cut-off follows kT~2.4 keV black body.

The effect of parameters like substrate\ntemperature, substrate cleaning, residual gases in the vacuum chamber,\nultrasonic vibration of the substrate, suggest that the mobility coalescence is\nresponsible for the aging in island metal films.

The key observation is that it is not\nalways necessary to refocus all the undesired couplings in a spin system.\nInstead the coupling evolution can simply be tracked and then corrected at some\nlater time. Although described within the language of NMR the algorithm is\napplicable to any design of quantum computer based on Ising couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2005 09:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To properly incorporate saturation effects, we use a quantum Langevin\napproach. In contrast to the standard optical Bloch equations, this method\nnaturally provides the inelastic spectrum of the radiated light induced by the\nquantum electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. However, to get the right spectral\nproperties of the scattered light, it is essential to correctly describe the\nstatistical properties of these vacuum fluctuations. Because of the presence of\nthe two atoms, these statistical properties are not Gaussian : (i) the spatial\ntwo-points correlation function displays a speckle-like behavior and (ii) the\nthree-points correlation function does not vanish. We also explain how to\nincorporate in a simple way propagation with a frequency-dependent scattering\nmean-free path, meaning that the two atoms are embedded in an average\nscattering dispersive medium. Finally we show that saturation-induced\nnonlinearities strongly modify the atomic scattering properties and, as a\nconsequence, provide a source of decoherence in multiple scattering. This is\nexemplified by considering the coherent backscattering configuration where\ninterference effects are blurred by this decoherence mechanism. This leads to a\ndecrease of the so-called coherent backscattering enhancement factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2005 12:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}
