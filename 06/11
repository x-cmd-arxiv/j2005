The RGS and EPIC MOS2 spectra were simultaneously\nfitted with collisional ionization equilibrium plasma models to determine\ncoronal abundances of various elements. Contrary to the solar first ionization\npotential (FIP) effect in which elements with a low FIP are overabundant in the\ncorona compared to the solar photosphere, and contrary to the ``inverse'' FIP\neffect observed in several active RS CVn binaries, coronal abundance ratios in\n$\\sigma^2$ CrB show a complex pattern as supported by similar findings in the\nChandra HETGS analysis of $\\sigma^2$ CrB with a different methodology (Osten et\nal. 2003). Low-FIP elements ($<10$ eV) have their abundance ratios relative to\nFe consistent with the solar photospheric ratios, whereas high-FIP elements\nhave their abundance ratios increase with increasing FIP. We find that the\ncoronal Fe abundance is consistent with the stellar photospheric value,\nindicating that there is no metal depletion in $\\sigma^2$ CrB. However, we\nobtain a higher Fe absolute abundance than in Osten et al. (2003). Except for\nAr and S, our absolute abundances are about 1.5 times larger than those\nreported by Osten et al. (2003). However, a comparison of their model with our\nXMM-Newton data (and vice versa) shows that both models work adequately in\ngeneral. We find, therefore, no preference for one methodology over the other\nto derive coronal abundances. Despite the systematic discrepancy in absolute\nabundances, our abundance ratios are very close to those obtained by Osten et\nal. (2003). Finally, we confirm the measurement of a low density in \\ion{O}{7}\n($< 4 \\times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$), but could not confirm the higher densities\nmeasured in spectral lines formed at higher temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2005 16:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This\npresents a data analysis challenge that is very different to the one\nencountered in ground based gravitational wave astronomy. LISA data analysis\nrequires the identification of individual signals from a data stream containing\nan unknown number of overlapping signals. Because of the signal overlaps, a\nglobal fit to all the signals has to be performed in order to avoid biasing the\nsolution. However, performing such a global fit requires the exploration of an\nenormous parameter space with a dimension upwards of 50,000.

The\nconstructed theory is invariant under a suitable unitary representation of the\nBMS group with manifest meaning when the fields are interpreted as suitable\nextensions to $\\Im^+$ of massless minimally coupled fields propagating in the\nbulk. The analysis of the found unitary BMS representation proves that such a\nfield on $\\Im^+$ coincides with the natural wave function constructed out of\nthe unitary BMS irreducible representation induced from the little group\n$\\Delta$, the semidirect product between SO(2) and the two dimensional\ntranslational group. The result proposes a natural criterion to solve the long\nstanding problem of the topology of BMS group. Indeed the found natural\ncorrespondence of quantum field theories holds only if the BMS group is\nequipped with the nuclear topology rejecting instead the Hilbert one.\nEventually some theorems towards a holographic description on $\\Im^+$ of QFT in\nthe bulk are established at level of $C^*$ algebras of fields for strongly\nasymptotically predictable spacetimes. It is proved that preservation of a\ncertain symplectic form implies the existence of an injective $*$-homomorphism\nfrom the Weyl algebra of fields of the bulk into that associated with the\nboundary $\\Im^+$. Those results are, in particular, applied to 4D Minkowski\nspacetime where a nice interplay between Poincar\\'e invariance in the bulk and\nBMS invariance on the boundary at $\\Im^+$ is established at level of QFT. It\narises that the $*$-homomorphism admits unitary implementation and Minkowski\nvacuum is mapped into the BMS invariant vacuum on $\\Im^+$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2005 13:28:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2006 19:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The model, in a certain limit, is the discrete analogue of a\ndeterministic continuum model suggested by others. We carry out extensive\ncomputer simulation of the model by utilizing it on lattices with infinite- or\nshort-range interactions, and on (directed) Barabasi-Albert scale-free\nnetworks. Several interesting features of the model are demonstrated, and\ncomparison is made with the continuum model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2005 00:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

More precisely, we show that a collection of m MUBs in K^n\ngives rise to a collection of m Cartan subalgebras of the special linear Lie\nalgebra sl_n(K) that are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the Killing form,\nwhere K=R or K=C. In particular, a complete collection of MUBs in C^n gives\nrise to a so-called orthogonal decomposition (OD) of sl_n(C). The converse\nholds if the Cartan subalgebras in the OD are also *-closed, i.e., closed under\nthe adjoint operation. In this case, the Cartan subalgebras have unitary bases,\nand the above correspondence becomes equivalent to a result relating\ncollections of MUBs to collections of maximal commuting classes of unitary\nerror bases, i.e., orthogonal unitary matrices.\n  It is a longstanding conjecture that ODs of sl_n(C) can only exist if n is a\nprime power. This corroborates further the general belief that a complete\ncollection of MUBs can only exist in prime power dimensions. The connection to\nODs of sl_n(C) potentially allows the application of known results on (partial)\nODs of sl_n(C) to MUBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2005 23:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
