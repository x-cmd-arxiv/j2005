The stellar library is\ncomposed of 1650 spectra computed with the latest improvements in stellar\natmospheres. In particular it incorporates non-LTE line-blanketed models for\nhot (Teff >= 27500 K) and LTE line-blanketed models (Phoenix) for cool (3000 K\n=< Teff =< 4500 K) stars. Because of the high spectral resolution of this\nlibrary, evolutionary synthesis models can be used to predict the strength of\nnumerous weak absorption lines, and the evolution of the profiles of the\nstrongest lines over a wide range of ages. The SSP results have been calculated\nfor ages 1 Myr to 17 Gyr using the stellar evolutionary provided by the Geneva\nand Padova-tracks groups. For young stellar populations, our results have a\nvery detailed coverage of high-temperature stars with similar results for\nPadova and Geneva isochrones.

The spectra cover SiO bands for\noxygen-rich stars, and acetylene (C2H2), CH and HCN bands for carbon-rich AGB\nstars. The equivalent width of acetylene is found to be high even at low\nmetallicity. The high C2H2 abundance can be explained with a high\ncarbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio for lower metallicity carbon stars. In contrast,\nthe HCN equivalent width is low: fewer than half of the extra-galactic carbon\nstars show the 3.5micron HCN band, and only a few LMC stars show high HCN\nequivalent width. HCN abundances are limited by both nitrogen and carbon\nelemental abundances. The amount of synthesized nitrogen depends on the initial\nmass, and stars with high luminosity (i.e. high initial mass) could have a high\nHCN abundance. CH bands are found in both the extra-galactic and Galactic\ncarbon stars. None of the oxygen-rich LMC stars show SiO bands, except one\npossible detection in a low quality spectrum. The limits on the equivalent\nwidths of the SiO bands are below the expectation of up to 30angstrom for LMC\nmetallicity. Several possible explanations are discussed. The observations\nimply that LMC and SMC carbon stars could reach mass-loss rates as high as\ntheir Galactic counterparts, because there are more carbon atoms available and\nmore carbonaceous dust can be formed. On the other hand, the lack of SiO\nsuggests less dust and lower mass-loss rates in low-metallicity oxygen-rich\nstars. The effect on the ISM dust enrichment is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2005 12:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-05"}

Our main conclusion is that the VL and\nRL zero-points and the uncorrelated residuals can only be reproduced\nsimultaneously if adiabatic contraction is avoided. One or the other could be\nfixed by appealing to unrealistic values for M/L, halo concentration c, and\nspin parameter lambda, but not all together. The small VL scatter is naturally\ndetermined by the predicted scatter in c and in M/L, quite independent of the\nlarge scatter in lambda. However, the RL scatter, driven by the scatter in\nlambda, can be as low as observed only if sigma_lambda simeq 0.25, about half\nthe value predicted for CDM haloes.

The VL slope is reproduced once star formation occurs\nonly above a threshold surface density, and the RL slope implies that the disc\nmass fraction is increasing with halo mass, consistent with feedback effects.
