Electrons are very efficiently accelerated by the accretion\nshock and acquire power-law distribution. The accelerated particles in turn\nemit synchrotron radiation in presence of a stochastic magnetic field in\nequipartition with the gas. Efficient cooling of the electrons by these soft\nphotons reduces its temperature in comparison to the protons. We explore the\nnature of the broadband spectra by using Comptonization, bremsstrahlung and\nsynchrotron emission. We then show that there could be two crossing points in a\nbroadband spectrum, one near $\\sim 10 keV$ and the other $\\sim 300-400$KeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2005 12:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In a previous work, we\nshowed that it is possible to use the X-ray spectra of young Type Ia supernova\nremnants to explore the physics of Type Ia supernovae and identify the relevant\nmechanism underlying these explosions. Our simulation technique is based on\nhydrodynamic and nonequilibrium ionization calculations of the interaction of a\ngrid of Type Ia explosion models with the surrounding ambient medium, coupled\nto an X-ray spectral code. In this work we explore the influence of two key\nparameters on the shape of the X-ray spectrum of the ejecta: the density of the\nambient medium around the supernova progenitor and the efficiency of\ncollisionless electron heating at the reverse shock. We also discuss the\nperformance of recent 3D simulations of Type Ia SN explosions in the context of\nthe X-ray spectra of young SNRs. We find a better agreement with the\nobservations for Type Ia supernova models with stratified ejecta than for 3D\ndeflagration models with well mixed ejecta. We conclude that our grid of Type\nIa supernova remnant models can improve our understanding of these objects and\ntheir relationship to the supernovae that originated them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2005 15:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The criterion of maximum von Neumann entropy is then used for making\nreasonable inferences. It means that no spurious information is introduced\nbesides the known data. Its outcomes can be given a direct justification based\non the principle of indifference of Laplace.

It was introduced by Michael Fisher and applications of the model to\nvarious wetting and melting phenomena were described in his Boltzmann medal\nlecture. In the present report, we explain interesting connections among\nrepresentation theory, probability theory, and random matrix theory using this\nsimple diffusion particle system. Each vicious walk of $N$ walkers is\nrepresented by an $N$-tuple of nonintersecting lattice paths on the\nspatio-temporal plane. There is established a simple bijection between\nnonintersecting lattice paths and semistandard Young tableaux. Based on this\nbijection and some knowledge of symmetric polynomials called the Schur\nfunctions, we can give a determinantal expression to the partition function of\nvicious walks, which is regarded as a special case of the Karlin-McGregor\nformula in the probability theory (or the Lindstr\\\"om-Gessel-Viennot formula in\nthe enumerative combinatorics). Due to a basic property of Schur function, we\ncan take the diffusion scaling limit of the vicious walks and define a\nnoncolliding system of Brownian particles. This diffusion process solves the\nstochastic differential equations with the drift terms acting as the repulsive\ntwo-body forces proportional to the inverse of distances between particles, and\nthus it is identified with Dyson's Brownian motion model. In other words, the\nobtained noncolliding system of Brownian particles is equivalent in\ndistribution with the eigenvalue process of a Hermitian matrix-valued process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2005 09:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The links are described by a real symmetric array r(i,j), i,j=1,...,N.\nIn a social group, nodes represent group members and links represent relations\nbetween them, positive (friendly) or negative (hostile). At the balanced state,\nr(i,j)r(j,k)r(k,i)>0 for all the triads (i,j,k). As follows from the structure\ntheorem of Cartwright and Harary, at this state the group is divided into two\nsubgroups, with friendly internal relations and hostile relations between the\nsubgroups. Here the system dynamics is proposed to be determined by a set of\ndifferential equations. The form of equations guarantees that once HB is\nreached, it persists. Also, for N=3 the dynamics reproduces properly the\ntendency of the system to the balanced state. The equations are solved\nnumerically. Initially, r(i,j) are random numbers distributed around zero with\na symmetric uniform distribution of unit width. Calculations up to N=500 show\nthat HB is always reached. Time to get the balanced state varies with the\nsystem size N as N^{-1/2}. The spectrum of relations, initially narrow, gets\nvery wide near HB. This means that the relations are strongly polarized. In our\ncalculations, the relations are limited to a given range around zero. With this\nlimitation, our results can be helpful in an interpretation of somestatistical\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2005 11:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The study is based on the\nanalysis of a large amount of repetitive elements deposited into the human\ngenome since the mammalian radiation, yielding a number of results that would\nhave been difficult to obtain using the more conventional comparative method of\nanalysis. This analysis revealed substantial and consistent variability of\nrates of substitution, with the variability ranging up to 2-fold among\ndifferent regions. The rates of substitutions of C or G nucleotides with A or T\nnucleotides vary much more sharply than the reverse rates suggesting that much\nof that variation is due to differences in mutation rates rather than in the\nprobabilities of fixation of C/G vs. A/T nucleotides across the genome. For all\ntypes of substitution we observe substantially more hotspots than coldspots,\nwith hotspots showing substantial clustering over tens of Mbp's. Our analysis\nrevealed that GC-content of surrounding sequences is the best predictor of the\nrates of substitution. The pattern of substitution appears very different near\ntelomeres compared to the rest of the genome and cannot be explained by the\ngenome-wide correlations of the substitution rates with GC content or exon\ndensity. The telomere pattern of substitution is consistent with natural\nselection or biased gene conversion acting to increase the GC-content of the\nsequences that are within 10-15 Mbp away from the telomere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2005 18:19:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Stationary discharges -- phase\nlocked, quasiperiodic, or chaotic -- were induced in a simulated neuron by\npresenting pacemaker presynaptic spike trains across a model of a prototypical\ninhibitory synapse. Reduced timing precision was modeled by jittering\npresynaptic spike times. Aftereffects of errors -- in this communication,\nmissed presynaptic spikes -- were determined by comparing postsynaptic spike\ntimes between simulations identical except for the presence or absence of\nerrors. Results show that the effects of an error vary greatly depending on the\nongoing dynamical behavior. In the case of phase lockings, a high degree of\npresynaptic spike timing precision can provide significantly faster error\nrecovery. For non-locked behaviors, isolated missed spikes can have little or\nno discernible aftereffects (or even serve to paradoxically reduce uncertainty\nin postsynaptic spike timing), regardless of presynaptic imprecision.
