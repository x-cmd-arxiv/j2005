The energy released in this burning, while the matter sinks into\nthe stellar crust under the weight of newly accreted material, is sufficient to\nwarm up the star and initiate neutrino emission in its core. The surface\nthermal radiation of the star in quiescent states becomes dependent of poorly\nknown equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear matter in the stellar core, which\ngives a method to explore this EOS.

Many NP-complete problems\ncan be encoded in the answer set semantics of logic programs in a very concise\nand intuitive way, where the encoding reflects the typical \"guess and check\"\nnature of NP problems: The property is encoded in a way such that polynomial\nsize certificates for it correspond to stable models of a program. However, the\nproblem-solving capacity of full disjunctive logic programs (DLPs) is beyond\nNP, and captures a class of problems at the second level of the polynomial\nhierarchy. While these problems also have a clear \"guess and check\" structure,\nfinding an encoding in a DLP reflecting this structure may sometimes be a\nnon-obvious task, in particular if the \"check\" itself is a coNP-complete\nproblem; usually, such problems are solved by interleaving separate guess and\ncheck programs, where the check is expressed by inconsistency of the check\nprogram.

A new computation of the modified K-energy is used to obtain a\ncharacterization of the admissible Kahler classes which contain an extremal\nKahler metric. In particular, these results complete the classification of\nextremal Kahler metrics on ruled surfaces.\n  3. The existence of extremal Kahler metrics is related to the notion of\nrelative K-stability leading in particular to some examples of projective\nvarieties which are destabilized by a non-algebraic degeneration.\n  We believe that these results add considerable interest to our work, and go\nfar beyond the original paper, which is why we have chosen to withdraw this\npaper and post the replacements as new submissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2005 17:38:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2005 18:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is proposed that an appropriate classical potential\ncan be constructed using ab initio data on the equilibrium and weakly strained\nconfigurations calculated from the quantum description, rather than the more\nusual approach of fitting to a wide range of empirical data. The scheme is\nillustrated in detail for a model system, silica nanorod that has the proper\nstiochiometric ratio of Si:O as observed in real silica. The potential is\nchosen to be pairwise additive, with the same pair potential functional form as\nfamiliar phenomenological TTAM potential. Here, the parameters are determined\nusing a genetic algorithm with force data obtained directly from a quantum\ncalculation. The resulting potential gives excellent agreement with properties\nof the reference quantum calculations both for structure (bond lengths, bond\nangles) and elasticity (Young's modulus). The proposed method for constructing\nthe classical potential is carried out for two different choices for the\nquantum mechanical description: a transfer Hamiltonian method (NDDO with\ncoupled cluster parameterization) and density functional theory (with plane\nwave basis set and PBE exchange correlation functional). The quality of the\npotentials obtained in both cases is quite good, although the two quantum rods\nhave significant differences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2005 18:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
