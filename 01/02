We employed the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to solve for the magnetization $M(B)$ curves\nfor several values of the damping constant $\\alpha$, the induction sweep rate,\nthe lattice constant $a$, the temperature $T$, and the magnetic anisotropy\nfield $H_A$. We find that the smaller the $\\alpha$, the stronger the maximum\ninduction required to produce hysteresis. The shape of the hysteresis loops\nalso depends on the damping constant. We find further that the system\nmagnetizes and demagnetizes at decreasing magnetic field strengths with\ndecreasing sweep rates, resulting in smaller hysteresis loops. Variations of\n$a$ within realistic values (1.5 nm - 2.5 nm) show that the dipolar interaction\nplays an important role in the magnetic hysteresis by controlling the\nrelaxation process. The $T$ dependencies of $\\alpha$ and of $M$ are presented\nand discussed with regard to recent experimental data on nanomagnets. $H_A$\nenhances the size of the hysteresis loops for external fields parallel to the\nanisotropy axis, but decreases it for perpendicular external fields.

The feasibility of overcoming of the fundamental limitation on a\nvelocity-interval of resonantly coupled molecules imposed by the Doppler effect\nis shown based on quantum coherence. This increases the efficiency of\nnonlinear-optical processes in atomic and molecular gases that possess the most\nnarrow and strongest resonances. The possibility of all-optical switching of\nthe medium to opaque or, alternatively, to absolutely transparent, or even to\nstrongly-amplifying states is explored, which is controlled by a small\nvariation of two driving radiations. The required intensities of the control\nfields are shown to be typical for cw lasers. These effects are associated with\nfour-wave mixing accompanied by Stokes gain and by their interference in fully-\nand near-resonant optically-dense far-from-degenerate double-Lambda medium.\nOptimum conditions for inversionless amplification of short-wavelength\nradiation above the oscillation threshold at the expense of the\nlonger-wavelength control fields, as well as for Raman gain of the generated\nidle infrared radiation, are investigated. The outcomes are illustrated with\nnumerical simulations applied to sodium dimer vapor. Similar schemes can be\nrealized in doped solids and in fiber optics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2005 16:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
