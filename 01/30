The most important gamma-ray lines result from the decay chains of\nNi-56, Ni-57, and Ti-44. Ni-56 is the prime explosive nucleosynthesis product\nof Type Ia supernovae, but Ni-56 is also a product of core-collapse supernovae.\nGamma-ray line emission from its daughter product, Co-56, has been detected\nfrom SN1987A. The early occurrence of this emission indicates that some\nfraction of Ni-56, which is synthesized in the innermost supernova layers, must\nhave mixed with the outermost ejecta.\n  Special attention is given to the gamma-ray line emission of the decay chain\nof Ti-44, giving line emission at 68 keV, 78 keV, and 1157keV. Given its decay\ntime of 86 yr, one expects this line emission from young supernova remnants.\nThe Ti-44 production is very sensitive to the explosion properties This makes\nTi-44 an ideal tool to study the inner layers of the supernova explosion.\n  The gamma-ray line emission from Ti-44 has so far only been detected from the\nsupernova remnant Cas A. I discuss these detections, which were made by COMPTEL\nand BeppoSAX, which suggest a Ti-44 yield of (1.5+/-1.0)x10^{-4} Msun.\nMoreover, I present some preliminary results of Cas A observations by INTEGRAL,\nwhich has yielded a 3sigma detection of the 68 keV line with the ISGRI\ninstrument at a level consistent with the BeppoSAX results. A preliminary\nanalysis of the vailable INTEGRAL-SPI data indicates that narrow line emission\n(Delta v < 1000 km/s) can be almost excluded at the 2sigma level.

The fluid motion\nnearly reduces to a free-fall, with a very low detachment velocity below the\ntube. Thus, the curtain contains a large subsonic area, i.e. a domain where the\nsinuous waves travel faster than the fluid. The upper boundary not being\nconstrained in the transverse direction, we have observed the appearance of an\nup to now unreported instability when the flow rate is progressively reduced:\nthe top of the curtain enters a pendulum-like motion, coupled to a propagative\npattern of curtain undulations, structured as a chessboard. Measurements of the\nphase velocity and frequency of this pattern are reported. Data are in\nagreement with a simple dimensional argument suggesting that the wave velocity\nis proportional to the surface tension divided by the mass flux of liquid per\nunit length. This scaling is also that followed by the fluid velocity at the\ntransonic point, i.e. the point where the fluid velocity equals that of sinuous\nwaves. We finally discuss implications of these results on the global stability\nof falling curtains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2005 15:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
