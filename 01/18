Our model traces the\nbuild-up of MBHs from an early epoch, and follows the merger history of dark\nmatter halos and their associated holes via Monte Carlo realizations of the\nmerger hierarchy from early times to the present time. The sequence of minor\nand major mergers experienced by galactic halos in their hierarchical growth\naffects the merger history of MBHs embedded in their nuclei. So, if the\nformation route for the assembly of SMBHs dates back to the early universe, a\nlarge number of BH interactions is inevitable. Binary black holes coalescence\ntimescales can be long enough for a third BH to fall in and interact with the\ncentral binary. These BH triple interactions lead typically to the final\nexpulsion of one of the three bodies and to the recoil of the binary. Also,\nasymmetric emission of gravitational waves in the last stages of the black hole\nmerging can give a recoil velocity to the centre of mass of the coalescing\nbinary. This scenario leads to the prediction of a population of intermediate\nmass BHs (IMBHs) wandering in galaxy halos at the present epoch. We compute the\nluminosity distribution produced by these IMBHs accreting from their\ncircumstellar medium.

Two patterns of correlated X-ray-optical/nIR behavior were found. During\nthe hard state the optical/nIR and X-ray fluxes correlated well, with a nIR vs.\nX-ray flux relation similar to the relation between X-ray and radio fluxes\nfound in previous studies of GX 339-4 and other black hole binaries. As GX\n339-4 went through an intermediate state the optical/nIR fluxes decreased\nrapidly and once it had entered the spectrally soft state, the optical/nIR\nspectrum was much bluer and the ratio of X-ray to nIR flux was higher by a\nfactor of more than 10 compared to the hard state.

Bars embedded in\nlive triaxial halos have a starkly different fate: they dissolve on ~1.5-5 Gyr\ndue to the onset of chaos over continuous zones, leaving behind a weak oval\ndistortion. The onset of chaos is related to the halo triaxiality, the fast\nrotating bar and the halo cuspiness.

The isotope effects\non the intrinsic electrical transport properties are not consistent with a\nsimple small-polaron hopping mechanism, but can be well explained by a model\nwhere there coexist immobile bipolarons and thermally-excited small polarons.\nRecently, Banerjee et al. [Phys. Rev. B 68, 186401 (2003)] wrote a Comment on\nour paper, where they misunderstood our theoretical model, erroneously thinking\nthat we explain the electrical transport in the paramagnetic state as due to\nbipolaron hopping. They confuse large polarons with small bipolarons, use\nincorrect conditions for bipolaron formation, and even incorrectly reproduce\nour data. We show that the model used in the Comment is inconsistent with any\nfeatures of the observed oxygen-isotope effects. More evidence is provided to\nsupport the theoretical model used in our original paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2005 21:30:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2005 19:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

No restriction is made on the charge, mass, or speed\nof this particle. It is, however, assumed that the plasma is not strongly\ncoupled in the sense that the dimensionless plasma coupling parameter\ng=e^2\\kappa_D/ 4\\pi T is small, where \\kappa_D is the Debye wave number of the\nplasma. To leading and next-to-leading order in this coupling, dE/dx is of the\ngeneric form g^2 \\ln[C g^2]. The precise numerical coefficient out in front of\nthe logarithm is well known. We compute the constant C under the logarithm\nexactly for arbitrary particle speeds. Our exact results differ from\napproximations given in the literature. The differences are in the range of 20%\nfor cases relevant to inertial confinement fusion experiments. The same method\nis also employed to compute the rate of momentum loss for a projectile moving\nin a plasma, and the rate at which two plasmas at different temperatures come\ninto thermal equilibrium. Again these calculations are done precisely to the\norder given above. The loss rates of energy and momentum uniquely define a\nFokker-Planck equation that describes particle motion in the plasma. The\ncoefficients determined in this way are thus well-defined, contain no arbitrary\nparameters or cutoffs, and are accurate to the order described. This\nFokker-Planck equation describes the longitudinal straggling and the transverse\ndiffusion of a beam of particles. It should be emphasized that our work does\nnot involve a model, but rather it is a precisely defined evaluation of the\nleading terms in a well-defined perturbation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2005 19:56:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2005 00:25:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2007 14:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
