The size of the patch may be varied, and this allows one to\nquantify the departures of these stochastic models from various mean field\ntheories, which are generally valid as the patch size becomes very large. These\nmodels may be used to formulate a broad range of biological processes in both\nspatial and non-spatial contexts. Here, we concentrate on two-species\ncompetition. We present both a mathematical analysis of the patch model, in\nwhich we derive the precise form of the competition mean field equations (and\ntheir first order corrections in the non-spatial case), and simulation results.\nThese mean field equations differ, in some important ways, from those which are\nnormally written down on phenomenological grounds. Our general conclusion is\nthat mean field theory is more robust for spatial models than for a single\nisolated patch. This is due to the dilution of stochastic effects in a spatial\nsetting resulting from repeated rescue events mediated by inter-patch\ndiffusion. However, discrete effects due to modest patch sizes lead to striking\ndeviations from mean field theory even in a spatial setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2005 14:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
