We improve on previous treatments\nby adopting a fully non-linear description of galaxy clustering and bias, which\nallows us to break parameter degeneracies by combining large-scale and small-\nscale distortions. We consider different combinations of Omega_m and sigma_8\nand find parameters of the galaxy halo occupation distribution (HOD) that yield\nnearly identical galaxy correlation functions in real space. We use these HOD\nparameters to populate the dark matter halos of large N-body simulations, from\nwhich we measure redshift-space distortions on small and large scales. We\ninclude a velocity bias parameter alpha_v that allows the velocity dispersions\nof satellite galaxies in halos to be systematically higher or lower than those\nof dark matter. Large-scale distortions are determined by the parameter\ncombination beta = Omega_m^{0.6}/b_g, where b_g is the galaxy bias, in\nagreement with linear theory. However, linear theory does not accurately\ndescribe the distortions themselves on scales accessible to our simulations. We\nprovide fitting formulas to estimate beta from the redshift-space correlation\nfunction or power spectrum, and we show that these formulas are significantly\nmore accurate than those in the existing literature. On small scales, the\n``finger-of-god'' distortions at projected separations ~0.1 Mpc/h depend on\nOmega_m*alpha_v^2 but are independent of sigma_8, while at intermediate\nseparations they depend on sigma_8 as well. One can thus use redshift-space\ndistortions over a wide range of scales to separately determine Omega_m,\nsigma_8, and alpha_v.

The problem is formulated as minimizing the strain energy\nsubject to rotation of the material axes, under a state of uniform stress. It\nis shown that a stationary value of the strain energy requires the stress and\nstrain tensors to have a common set of principal axes. The new derivation of\nthis well known coaxiality condition uses the 6-dimensional expression of the\nrotation tensor for the elastic moduli. Using this representation it is shown\nthat the stationary condition is a minimum or a maximum if an explicit set of\nconditions is satisfied. Specific results are given for materials of cubic,\ntransversely isotropic (TI) and tetragonal symmetries. In each case the\nexistence of a minimum or maximum depends on the sign of a single elastic\nconstant. The stationary (minimum or maximum) value of energy can always be\nachieved for cubic materials.

The central idea of fluctuating-field theories is\nto rewrite the partition function of the interacting multi-chain systems in\nterms of integrals over auxiliary, often complex, fields, which are introduced\nby means of appropriate Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations. Thermodynamic\naverages like the average composition and the structure factor can be expressed\nexactly as averages of these fields. We discuss different analytical and\nnumerical approaches to studying such a theory: The self-consistent field\napproach solves the integrals over the fluctuating fields in saddle-point\napproximation. Generalized random phase approximations allow to incorporate\nGaussian fluctuations around the saddle point. Field theoretical polymer\nsimulations are used to study the statistical mechanics of the full system with\nComplex Langevin or Monte Carlo methods. Unfortunately, they are hampered by\nthe presence of a sign problem. In dense system, the latter can be avoided\nwithout losing essential physics by invoking a saddle point approximation for\nthe complex field that couples to the total density. This leads to the external\npotential theory. We investigate the conditions under which this approximation\nis accurate. Finally, we discuss recent approaches to formulate realistic\ndynamical time evolution equations for such models. The methods are illustrated\nby two examples: A study of the fluctuation-induced formation of a polymeric\nmicroemulsion in a polymer-copolymer mixture, and a study of early-stage\nspinodal decomposition in a binary blend.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2005 13:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The S271 and\nZ271 effective interactions yield even smaller values of $S$ = 0.11 fm, which\nare similar to those for nonrelativistic mean field models. A precise\nmeasurement of the neutron radius, and therefore $S$, in $^{208}$Pb will place\nan important constraint on both relativistic and nonrelativistic mean field\nmodels. We also study the correlation between the radius of a 1.4 solar-mass\nneutron star and $S$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2005 07:33:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

CEIMC can, in principle,\novercome some of the limitations of the present DFT based ab initio dynamical\nmethods.

In this paper we present a new sampling algorithm that we\nhave developed in the framework of the Reptation Quantum Monte Carlo (RQMC)\nmethod chosen to sample the electronic degrees of freedom, thereby improving\nits efficiency.

However, when the number of the\nmolecules is small, the fluctuations cannot be neglected. We often study the\neffects of fluctuations with the help of stochastic differential equations.\n  Chemicals are composed of molecules on a microscopic level. In principle, the\nnumber of molecules must be an integer, which must only change discretely.\nHowever, in analysis using stochastic differential equations, the fluctuations\nare regarded as continuous changes. This approximation can only be valid if\napplied to fluctuations that involve a sufficiently large number of molecules.\nIn the case of extremely rare chemical species, the actual discreteness of the\nmolecules may critically affect the dynamics of the system.\n  To elucidate the effects of the discreteness, we study an autocatalytic\nsystem consisting of several interacting chemical species with a small number\nof molecules through stochastic particle simulations. We found novel states,\nwhich were characterized as an extinction of molecule species, due to the\ndiscrete nature of the molecules.
