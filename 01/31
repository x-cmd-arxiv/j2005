The source is well-fit by a prolate\nspheroid, having an ellipsoidal power-law density distribution of index m ~ 2\n(1.75 < m < 2.25) in to at least r ~ 1600AU. For r<1600 AU, the data are\nconsistent with either an extension of the power law to smaller radii, or a\nflattened (Bonner-Ebert like) density distribtion. We can further constrain the\noptical depth along the short axis at 1300um to be ~ 5e-3, the central\nluminosity to be L < 1e-3 solar luminosities, the long axis diameter D ~ 0.1\npc, the axis ratio to be q ~ 2, and the external ISRF to be similar to that\ndefined by Mathis, Mezger, & Panagia (1983) to within 50 per cent. The outer\ndiameter and axis ratio may each be somewhat larger due to potential on-source\nchopping in the observations, and the projection of the long axis onto the\nplane of the sky. While these results are similar to those inferred directly\nfrom observations or spherical modeling due to the source transparency at\nsubmillimeter wavelengths, we infer a smaller size, lower mass, and higher\noptical depth / column density, exposed to a stronger external radiation field\nthan previously assumed. Finally, we find that both the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) and surface brightness distribution are necessary to\nconstrain the source properties in this way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2005 15:22:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The\nmethod allows one to check errors in ray theory at finite wavelengths. Acoustic\npropagation at long distance in the oceanic waveguide (50-100 Hz, 0.05 s\nresolution) has significant deviations from ray theory. The boundary condition\nof zero pressure at the surface of the ocean appears to cause sound to travel\nin a nearly horizontal trajectory for a much greater distance near the surface\nthan predicted by rays. The first Fresnel zone is an inappropriate scale to\ncharacterize where transient sounds travel near a ray path as assumed by a\nstandard scattering theory. Instead, the Fresnel zone is too large by an order\nof magnitude for cases investigated here. Regions where sounds travel can have\ncomplicated structures defying a simple length scale.

The results in this\npaper address this fundamental issue in the specific context of transcription\nregulatory networks. Although simple recurring regulatory motifs have been\nidentified in the past, due to the size and complexity of the connectivity\nstructure, the subdivision of such networks into larger, and possibly\ninter-connected, regulatory modules is still under investigation. Specifically,\nit is unclear whether functionally well-characterized transcriptional\nsub-networks can be identified by solely analyzing the connectivity structure\nof the overall network topology. In this paper, we show that transcriptional\nregulatory networks can be systematically partitioned into communities whose\nmembers are consistently functionally related.
