After a short\nintroduction, the main consequences of percolation of color sources on the\nfollowing observables in A-A collisions: $J/\\psi$ suppression, saturation of\nthe multiplicity, dependence on the centrality of the transverse momentum\nfluctuations, Cronin effect and transverse momentum distributions, strength of\nthe two and three body Bose-Einstein correlations and forward-backward\nmultiplicity correlations, are presented. The behaviour of all of them can be\nnaturally explained by the clustering of color sources and the dependence of\nthe fluctuations of the number of these clusters on the density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2005 18:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-07"}

We show that\na phase gate can be realized if we apply on each encased spin static and time\ndependent magnetic field. We have evaluated the operational time of a\n$\\pi$-phase gate, which is of the order of ns. We made a comparison between the\ntheoretical estimation of the gate time and the experimental decoherence time\nfor each spin. The comparison shows that the spin relaxation time is much\nlarger than the $\\pi$-gate operational time. Therefore, this indicates that,\nduring the decoherence time, it is possible to perform some thousands of\nquantum computational operations. Moreover, through the study of concurrence,\nwe get very good results for the entanglement degree of the two-qubit system.\nThis finding opens a new avenue for the realization of Quantum Computers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2005 16:55:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2005 20:39:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2005 16:16:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
