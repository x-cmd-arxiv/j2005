If one of the two QSO images is lightly reddened or\nif the dust along both sightlines has the same properties then the method works\nwell and produces an extinction curve for the lensing galaxy. These cases are\nlikely rare and hard to confirm. However, if the dust along each sightline has\ndifferent properties then the resulting curve is no longer a measurement of\nextinction. Instead, it is a measurement of the difference between two\nextinction curves. This \"lens difference curve'' does contain information about\nthe dust properties, but extracting a meaningful extinction curve is not\npossible without additional, currently unknown information. As a quantitative\nexample, we show that the combination of two Cardelli, Clayton, & Mathis (CCM)\ntype extinction curves having different values of R(V) will produce a CCM\nextinction curve with a value of R(V) which is dependent on the individual R(V)\nvalues and the ratio of V band extinctions. The resulting lens difference curve\nis not an average of the dust along the two sightlines. We find that lens\ndifference curves with any value of R(V), even negative values, can be produced\nby a combination of two reddened sightlines with different CCM extinction\ncurves with R(V) values consistent with Milky Way dust (2.1 < R(V) < 5.6). This\nmay explain extreme values of R(V) inferred by this method in previous studies.\nBut lens difference curves with more normal values of R(V) are just as likely\nto be composed of two dust extinction curves with R(V) values different than\nthat of the lens difference curve. While it is not possible to determine the\nindividual extinction curves making up a lens difference curve, there is\ninformation about a galaxy's dust contained in the lens difference curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2005 21:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This latter\nproperty allows the heavy tailedness of the log returns of the stock prices to\nbe also accounted for in addition to the long range dependence introduced by\nthe fractional Brownian motion. Work has been done previously on this problem\nfor the case with constant `volatility' and without a time change; here these\nresults are extended to the case of stochastic volatility models when the\nmodulator is fractional Brownian motion or a time change of it. (Volatility in\nfractional Black-Scholes models does not carry the same meaning as in the\nclassic Black-Scholes framework, which is made clear in the text.)\n  Since fractional Brownian motion is not a semi-martingale, the Black-Scholes\ndifferential equation is not well-defined sense for arbitrary predictable\nvolatility processes. However, it is shown here that any almost surely\ncontinuous and adapted process having zero quadratic variation can act as an\nintegrator over functions of the integrator and over the family of continuous\nadapted semi-martingales. Moreover it is shown that the integral also has zero\nquadratic variation, and therefore that the integral itself can be an\nintegrator. This property of the integral is crucial in developing the\narbitrage strategy. Since fractional Brownian motion and a time change of\nfractional Brownian motion have zero quadratic variation, these results are\napplicable to these cases in particular.

Through the use of spreading\nsequences, the processing gain of Random CDMA systems (RCDMA), is devoted to\nboth bandwidth expansion and orthogonalization of the signals transmitted by\ndifferent users. Another type of multiple access system is Impulse Radio (IR).\nIn many aspects, IR systems are similar to time division multiple access (TDMA)\nsystems, and the processing gain of IR systems represents the ratio between the\nactual transmission time and the total time between two consecutive\nransmissions (on-plus-off to on ratio). While CDMA systems, which constantly\nexcite the channel, rely on spreading sequences to orthogonalize the signals\ntransmitted by different users, IR systems transmit a series of short pulses\nand the orthogonalization between the signals transmitted by different users is\nachieved by the fact that most of the pulses do not collide with each other at\nthe receiver.\n  In this paper, a general class of MA communication systems that use both\ntypes of processing gain is presented, and both IR and RCDMA systems are\ndemonstrated to be two special cases of this more general class of systems. The\nbit error rate (BER) of several receivers as a function of the ratio between\nthe two types of processing gain is analyzed and compared under the constraint\nthat the total processing gain of the system is large and fixed.
