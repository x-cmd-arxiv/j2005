We have detected X-ray emission from several of the radio\nknots to the E of the active nucleus, and diffuse emission from the radio lobe\nto the W. The X-ray emission from the eastern knots cannot be explained by an\ninverse Compton model unless they are far from equipartition. Using archival\nHST data, optical emission is detected from two knots, and the\nradio/optical/X-ray spectra are well fitted by simple synchrotron models. This\nis one of the strongest examples to date of X-ray synchrotron emission from\nmultiple knots in the jet of an FR II radio galaxy.

Abell 262, 347, 400, 426, 569, 779, 1367 and 1656) to include a\ncomplete sample of early-type galaxies within 1.5 Abell radii of the cluster\ncentres. Of the 379 galaxies surveyed, 3% of E, E-S0 galaxies, 6% of S0s and 9%\nof S0/a galaxies were detected in emission. From a comparison of cluster and\nsupercluster field galaxies, we conclude that the frequency of emission-line\ngalaxies (ELGs; W_lambda >/= 20 angstroms) is similar for field and cluster\nearly-type galaxies. A similar result has previously been obtained for galaxies\nof types Sa and later. Together, these results confirm the inference of Biviano\net al. that the relative frequency of ELGs in clusters and the field can be\nentirely accounted for by the different mix of morphological types between the\ndiffering environments. Detected emission is classified as `compact' or\n`diffuse', identified as circumnuclear starburst or AGN emission and disk\nemission respectively. By comparing spectroscopic data for cluster early-type\nELGs with data for field galaxies from the Palomar Spectroscopic Survey of\nnearby galactic nuclei, we demonstrate there is modest evidence for an\nenhancement of compact HII emission relative to AGN emission in the early-type\ncluster ELGs as compared to the field. For the cluster early-type galaxies,\ncompact HII emission correlates strongly with a disturbed morphology. This\nsuggests that, as for later type cluster galaxies, this enhanced compact HII\nemission can readily be explained as an enhancement of circumnuclear starburst\nemission due to gravitational tidal interactions, most likely caused by\nsub-cluster merging and other on-going processes of cluster virialisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2005 11:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Assuming the dust is all of the\nsame size, the resulting surface density distribution can be derived\nanalytically and depends only on the parameter eta0=5000tau*sqrt(Mstar/r)/beta;\nthis parameter can be determined observationally with the hypothesis that\nbeta=0.5. For massive belts in which eta0>>1 dust is confined to the\nplanetesimal belt, while the surface density of more tenuous belts, in which\neta0<<1, is constant with distance from the star. The emission spectrum of dust\nfrom planetesimal belts at different distances from different mass stars shows\nthat the dust belts which have been detected to date should have eta0>>1; dust\nbelts with eta0<<1 are hard to detect as they are much fainter than the stellar\nphotosphere. This is confirmed for a sample of 37 debris disk candidates for\nwhich eta0 was determined to be >10. This means that these disks are so massive\nthat mutual collisions prevent dust from reaching the inner regions of these\nsystems and P-R drag can be ignored when studying their dynamics. Models for\nthe formation of structure in debris disks by the trapping of particles into\nplanetary resonances by P-R drag should be reconsidered. However, since\ncollisions do not halt 100% of the dust, this means that in the absence of\nplanetary companions debris disk systems should be populated by small\nquantities of hot dust which may be detectable in the mid-IR. Even in disks\nwith eta0<<1 the temperature of dust emission is shown to be a reliable tracer\nof the planetesimal distribution meaning that inner holes in the dust\ndistribution imply a lack of colliding planetesimals in the inner regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2005 12:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

An infinite system of point charges is called\ntotally disordered if the locations of the points and the values of the charges\nare random. It is called electroneutral if the mean charge is zero. In one\ndimension, we show that the electric field is always small, of the order of the\nfield of a single charge, and the spatial variations in potential are what can\nbe produced by a single charge. In two and three dimensions, the electric field\nin similarly disordered electroneutral systems is usually small, with small\nvariations.

We show that to any such operator one can associate a maximally symmetric\nboundary condition for gauge fields on AdS^2\\times S^2. We show that Wilson-'t\nHooft operators are classifed by a pair of weights (electric and magnetic) for\nthe gauge group and its magnetic dual, modulo the action of the Weyl group. If\nthe magnetic weight does not belong to the coroot lattice of the gauge group,\nthe corresponding operator is topologically nontrivial (carries nonvanishing 't\nHooft magnetic flux). We explain how the spectrum of Wilson-'t Hooft operators\ntransforms under the shift of the theta-angle by 2\\pi. We show that, depending\non the gauge group, either SL(2,Z) or one of its congruence subgroups acts in a\nnatural way on the set of Wilson-'t Hooft operators. This can be regarded as\nevidence for the S-duality of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. We also compute the\none-point function of the stress-energy tensor in the presence of a Wilson-'t\nHooft operator at weak coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2005 01:10:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2005 18:31:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 May 2006 20:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
