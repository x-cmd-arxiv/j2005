The influence of\ngravitational redshift on the level of maser saturation and the line strength\nand width of systemic water maser emission is studied. The effective\ngravitational velocity shift along the gain path through the disk amounts to\nabout twice the thermal velocity width of H2O molecules at 500 K for a masing\nring of thickness 0.2R_0. This GR induced frequency shift has a sign opposite\nto the shift caused by the projected velocity difference vector of Keplerian\nmotion on the blue side of the systemic maser emission and has the same sign on\nthe red systemic side. Consequently, the negative optical depth that a line\nphoton sees as it traverses the masing disk along a path of minimal Keplerian\nvelocity gradient is larger on the blue side. Note that one is not concerned\nhere with an overall shift in the maser spectrum caused by the fact that the\nmasing ring as a whole is located in the black hole's potential well, i.e., it\nis the change in the gravitational potential along the gain path that matters.\nIt is found, for a Schwarzschild metric, that saturation is enhanced\n(suppressed) for systemic blue-shifted (red-shifted) maser features by\ngravitational redshift of line photons. Approaching peak flux systemic features\nare, on average, brighter, due to saturation, and wider (~2 km/s), due to\nrebroadening, than their receding counterparts (~1 km/s). The effects are\nconsistent with observations that span several years, i.e., over periods longer\nthan needed for disk material to move through the systemic emission region.\nFurther confirmation of this effect can follow by combining all available\nsystemic 22 GHz data over the past two decades (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2005 16:23:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2005 15:14:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The first two regimes are perturbative in nature and the effective\ngenerators they determine is such that a non-trivial invariant sub-algebra of\nobservables naturally emerges. The third asymptotic regime goes beyond the\nperturbative regime and provides an effective dynamics governed by a general\nLindblad generator naturally constructed from the interaction Hamiltonian.\nConversely, this result shows that one can attach to any Lindblad generator a\nrepeated quantum interactions model whose asymptotic effective evolution is\ngenerated by this Lindblad operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2005 15:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Such systems evolve under the action of macroscopic driving (typically\nthe solar heating) and modulating (e.g. the Earth's rotation and gravitation)\nagents. The most comprehensive example is the entire climatic system. The\ndescription of the macroscopic dynamics of environmental systems is based on\nthe systematic use of dominant balances derived on a phenomenological basis in\norder to specialize the dynamical equations. Such balances are suitable classes\nof approximate solutions of the evolution equations which represent a\nreasonably good approximation to the actual observed fields when sufficiently\nlarge spatial or temporal averages are considered. Actually, different balances\nhave to be considered depending on the time and space scales we are focusing\nour interest on. Such an approach reflects the fundamentally\nheuristic-inductive nature of the scientific research in environmental\nsciences, where the traditional reductionistic scientific attitude is not\nalways effective. In order to exemplify this procedure, we consider the very\nrelevant case of the motion of the fluids that permit the existence of life on\nthe Earth, air and water: the so-called geophysical fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2005 11:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
