We combine our dataset with available CO measurements to model the\nphysical conditions in the disk. We find that the molecular gas in the region\nis both warm and dense, with T~200-300 K, n_H2~50,000-70,000 cm^-3. The mass of\nwarm molecular gas we measure in the central two parsecs is at least 2000\nM_solar, about 20 times the UV-excited atomic gas mass, ruling out an UV\nheating scenario for the molecular material. We compare the available spectral\ntracers with theoretical models and conclude that molecular gas is heated with\nmagneto-hydrodynamic shocks with v~10-20 kms and B~0.3-0.5 mG. Using the\nconditions derived with the CO analysis, we include the other important\ncoolants--neutral oxygen and molecular hydrogen--to estimate the total cooling\nbudget of the molecular material. We derive a mass to luminosity ratio of 2-3\nM_solar/ L_solar, which is consistent with the total power dissipated via\nturbulent decay in 0.1 pc cells with v_rms~15 kms. These size and velocity\nscales are comparable to the observed clumping scale and the velocity\ndispersion. At this rate, the material near Sgr A* its dissipating its orbital\nenergy on an orbital timescale, and cannot last for more than a few orbits. Our\nconclusions support a scenario in which the features near Sgr A* such as the\nCND and northern arm are generated by infalling clouds with low specific\nangular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2005 03:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This confusion has been accentuated by recent challenges to the second\nlaw and by the difficulty in many cases of clarifying which formulation is\nthreatened and how serious the implications of a successful challenge would be.\nTo help bring clarity and consistency to the analysis of these challenges, the\naim of this paper is to suggest a simple formulation of the deep physics of the\nsecond law, and to point out how such a statement might help us organize the\nchallenges by level of seriousness. We pursue the notion that the second law is\nultimately a restriction operating directly on the dynamics of information, so\nthe existence of this law can be traced to the need for a system of\n\"information bookkeeping\" that is independent of the bookkeeping for energy.\nEnergy and information are related but independent, so the dynamical\nrestrictions for one cannot be derived from those for the other. From this\nperspective, we also suggest the possibility that the foundation of the second\nlaw may be linked to the finite capacity of nature to store information about\nits own state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2005 01:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Average\nboundary concentrations have to be maintained at their values in the baths by\ninjecting and removing particles at the interfaces. The particles injected into\nthe simulation volume represent a unidirectional diffusion flux, while the\noutgoing particles represent the unidirectional flux in the opposite direction.\nThe classical diffusion equation defines net diffusion flux, but not\nunidirectional fluxes. The stochastic formulation of classical diffusion in\nterms of the Wiener process leads to a Wiener path integral, which can split\nthe net flux into unidirectional fluxes. These unidirectional fluxes are\ninfinite, though the net flux is finite and agrees with classical theory. We\nfind that the infinite unidirectional flux is an artifact caused by replacing\nthe Langevin dynamics with its Smoluchowski approximation, which is classical\ndiffusion. The Smoluchowski approximation fails on time scales shorter than the\nrelaxation time $1/\\gamma$ of the Langevin equation. We find the unidirectional\nflux (source strength) needed to maintain average boundary concentrations in a\nmanner consistent with the physics of Brownian particles. This unidirectional\nflux is proportional to the concentration and inversely proportional to\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta t}$ to leading order. We develop a BD simulation that maintains\nfixed average boundary concentrations in a manner consistent with the actual\nphysics of the interface and without creating spurious boundary layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2005 17:30:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In this Chapter, above all, the authors\ngive a brief introduction to some important work on mechanical properties of\nlipid bilayers following Helfrich's seminal work on spontaneous curvature\nenergy of lipid bilayers. Next, the entropy of a polymer confined in a curved\nsurface and the free energy of membrane cytoskeleton are obtained by scaling\nanalysis. It is found that the free energy of cell membranes has the form of\nthe in-plane strain energy plus Helfrich's curvature energy. The equations to\ndescribe equilibrium shapes and in-plane strains of cell membranes by osmotic\npressures are obtained by taking the first order variation of the total free\nenergy containing the elastic free energy, the surface tension energy and the\nterm induced by osmotic pressure. The stability of spherical cell membrane is\ndiscussed and the critical pressure is found to be much larger than that of\nspherical lipid bilayer without membrane cytoskeleton. Lastly, the authors try\nto extend the present static mechanical model of cell membranes to the cell\nstructure dynamics by proposing a group of coupling equations involving\ntensegrity architecture of cytoskeleton, fluid dynamics of cytoplasm and\nelasticities of cell membranes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2005 13:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-26"}

While mechanisms of cooperativity have\nbeen studied most extensively in the context of transcriptional initiation\ncontrol, cooperativity from other processes involved in the operation of the\ncircuits can also play important roles. In this study, we examine a simple\nkinetic source of cooperativity stemming from the nonlinear degradation of\nmultimeric proteins. Ample experimental evidence suggests that protein subunits\ncan degrade less rapidly when associated in multimeric complexes, an effect we\nrefer to as cooperative stability. For dimeric transcription factors, this\neffect leads to a concentration-dependence in the degradation rate because\nmonomers, which are predominant at low concentrations, will be more rapidly\ndegraded. Thus cooperative stability can effectively widen the accessible range\nof protein levels in vivo. Through theoretical analysis of two exemplary\ngenetic circuits in bacteria, we show that such an increased range is important\nfor the robust operation of genetic circuits as well as their evolvability. Our\ncalculations demonstrate that a few-fold difference between the degradation\nrate of monomers and dimers can already enhance the function of these circuits\nsubstantially. These results suggest that cooperative stability needs to be\nconsidered explicitly and characterized quantitatively in any systematic\nexperimental or theoretical study of gene circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2005 15:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
