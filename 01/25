The physical problems are presented as example of exotic matter at\nlow temperature with three major insights: the localisation of the 4f\nelectrons, the collapse of the long range magnetic order and the entrance in an\nintermediate valence regime. The question on the first or second order nature\nof the quantum phase transition will be discussed. In the first example, the\nIsing Kondo lattice of CeRu2Si2, experiments seem to be described with the\npicture of 4f itinerant electron dominated by their spin fluctuations; the\nstrong feedback, induced in magnetic field, between magnetostriction and switch\nin the nature of the magnetic interactions illustrates the proximity of a\nquantum critical field. Comparison is made with CeCu6 or YbRh2Si2 series where\nthe idea of local criticality seems to emerge. Basic arguments are discussed\nfor the breakdown of the idea that Yb heavy fermion systems are the the hole\nanalogue of the cerium ones. Special focus is given on the interplay between\nunconconventional superconductivity and magnetism either for dominant\nantiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic correlations. Huge electronic Gruneisen\nparameter leads often to strong concomitant 4f density and spin fluctuations\n>.The main boost given by the discovery of new materials as quasi-bidimensional\nCe 115 compounds or recently by CePt3 Si or skutterudites is spectacular for\nthe theoretical developments. Finally, the now canonical cases of the UPt3,\nURu2Si2, UPd2Al3 and UBe13 give now a sound basis in the rich domain of\nunconventional superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2005 15:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Heavy-to-light\nratios are mainly sensitive to the mass and color-charge dependences of\nmedium-induced parton energy loss. Here, we assess the potential for\nidentifying these two effects in D and B meson production at RHIC and at the\nLHC. To this end, we supplement the perturbative QCD factorized formalism for\nleading hadron production with radiative parton energy loss. For D meson\nspectra at high but experimentally accessible transverse momentum (10 < pT < 20\nGeV) in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC, we find that charm quarks behave\nessentially like light quarks. However, since light-flavored hadron yields are\ndominated by gluon parents, the heavy-to-light ratio of D mesons is a sensitive\nprobe of the color charge dependence of parton energy loss. In contrast, due to\nthe larger b quark mass, the medium modification of B mesons in the same\nkinematical regime provides a sensitive test of the mass dependence of parton\nenergy loss. At RHIC energies, the strategies for identifying and disentangling\nthe color charge and mass dependence of parton energy loss are more involved\nbecause of the smaller kinematical range accessible. We argue that at RHIC, the\nkinematical regime best suited for such an analysis of D mesons is 7 < pT < 12\nGeV, whereas the study of lower transverse momenta is further complicated due\nto the known dominant contribution of additional, particle species dependent,\nnon-perturbative effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2005 22:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The solution to CLP is known to be positive for\nall S such that $|S|\\leq\\aleph\\_1$. Furthermore, one can then take L with\npermutable congruences.

The maximal semilattice quotient of Dim L is isomorphic to\nthe semilattice Conc L of compact congruences of L; hence Dim L is a precursor\nof the congruence lattice of L.

Young's and other\ninterference experiments are explained with a hypothesis that there is a\ncoupling interaction between the peaked and non-peaked pieces of the wave\npacket. This explanation of the interference experiments provides a realistic\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics. The interpretation implies that there is\nphysical reality of particles and no wave function collapse. It also implies\nthat neither classical mechanics nor current quantum mechanics is a complete\ntheory for describing physical reality and the Bell inequalities are not the\nproper touchstones for reality and locality. The problems of the boundary\nbetween the macro-world and micro-world and the de-coherence in the transition\nregion (meso-world) between the two are discussed. The present interpretation\nof quantum mechanics is consistent with the physical aspects of the Copenhagen\ninterpretation, such as, the superposition principle, Heisenberg's uncertainty\nprinciple and Born's probability interpretation, but does not favor its\nphilosophical aspects, such as, non-reality, non-objectivity, non-causality and\nthe complementary principle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2005 11:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
