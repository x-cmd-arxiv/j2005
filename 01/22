Both findings suggest that the density profile of haloes\ndoes not depend on their aggregation history. Yet, this possibility is\napparently at odds with some correlations involving the scale radius r_s found\nin numerical simulations. Here we prove that the scale radius of relaxed,\nnon-rotating, spherically symmetric haloes endowed with the universal density\nprofile is determined exclusively by the current values of four independent,\nthough correlated, quantities: mass, energy and their respective instantaneous\naccretion rates. Under this premise and taking into account the inside-out\ngrowth of haloes during the accretion phase between major mergers, we build a\nsimple physical model for the evolution of r_s along the main branch of halo\nmerger trees that reproduces all the empirical trends shown by this parameter\nin N-body simulations. This confirms the conclusion that the empirical\ncorrelations involving r_s do not actually imply the dependence of this\nparameter on the halo aggregation history.

Collisions of these flux\ntubes will in general be three dimensional, and will often lead to\nreconnection, both rearranging the magnetic field topology in fundamental ways,\nand releasing magnetic energy. With the goal of better understanding these\ndynamics, we carry out a set of numerical experiments exploring fundamental\ncharacteristics of three dimensional magnetic flux tube reconnection. We first\nshow that reconnecting flux tubes at opposite extremes of twist behave very\ndifferently: in some configurations, low twist tubes slingshot while high twist\ntubes tunnel. We then discuss a theory explaining these differences: by\nassuming helicity conservation during the reconnection one can show that at\nhigh twist, tunneled tubes reach a lower magnetic energy state than slingshot\ntubes, whereas at low twist the opposite holds. We test three predictions made\nby this theory. 1) We find that the level of twist at which the transition from\nslingshot to tunnel occurs is about two to three times higher than predicted on\nthe basis of energetics and helicity conservation alone, probably because the\ndynamics of the reconnection play a large role as well. 2) We find that the\ntunnel occurs at all flux tube collision angles predicted by the theory. 3) We\nfind that the amount of magnetic energy a slingshot or a tunnel reconnection\nreleases agrees reasonably well with the theory, though at the high\nresistivities we have to use for numerical stability, a significant amount of\nmagnetic energy is lost to diffusion, independent of reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2005 19:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The MDL estimator is\nknown to be a consistent estimator, robust against deviations from the Gaussian\nassumption, and non-robust against deviations from the point source and/or\ntemporally or spatially white additive noise assumptions. Over the years\nseveral alternative estimation algorithms have been proposed and tested.\nUsually, these algorithms are shown, using computer simulations, to have\nimproved performance over the MDL estimator, and to be robust against\ndeviations from the assumed spatial model.

The\nconsistency of this estimator, even when deviations from the equal noise level\nassumption occur, is proven.

While the vector\nelectroweak form factors provide information about the nucleon's charge and\nmagnetism, the axial form factor is related to the nucleon's spin. Its Q2=0\nvalue at leading order, g_A, is well known from nucleon and nuclear beta decay,\nand its precise determination is of interest for tests of CKM unitarity.
