In order to study the\nunderlying physics of these structures, we have calculated synthetic Halpha\nspectra of TT Hya, which is an Algol-type eclipsing binary with an accretion\ndisc. Both the primary and secondary stars were considered in the calculations\nas well as a disc surrounding the primary. The Roche model for the secondary\nstar was assumed. The synthetic spectra cover all the phases including primary\neclipse and are compared with the observed spectra. The influence of various\neffects and free parameters of the disc on the emerging spectrum was studied.\nThis enabled us to put some constraints on the geometry, temperature, density\nand velocity fields within the disc. Differences found between the observed and\nsynthetic spectra unravel the existence of a gas stream as well as a hotter\ndisc-gas interaction region. An additional cooler circumstellar region between\nthe C1 and C2 Roche surfaces is suggested to account for various observed\neffects. A new computer code called {\\sc{shellspec}} was created for this\npurpose and is briefly described in this work as well. It is designed to solve\nsimple radiative transfer along the line of sight in 3D moving media. The\nscattered light from a central object is taken into account assuming an\noptically thin environment. Output intensities are then integrated through the\n2D projection surface of a 3D object. The assumptions of the code include LTE\nand optional known state quantities and velocity fields in 3D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2005 18:39:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The coupling may occur through either the\nelectric or the magnetic eld of the cavity mode. When a current is injected\ninto the junction, we nd that the time-averaged voltage exhibits self-induced\nresonant steps due to coupling between the current in the junction and the\nelectric eld of the cavity mode. These steps are similar to those observed and\ncalculated in small Josephson junctions. When a soliton is present in the\njunction (corresponding to a quantum of magnetic ux parallel to the junction\nplates), the SIRS's disappear if the electric eld in the cavity is spatially\nuniform. If the cavity mode has a spatially varying electric eld, there is a\nstrong coupling between the soliton and the cavity mode. This coupling causes\nthe soliton to become phase-locked to the cavity mode, and produces step-like\nanomalies on the soliton branch of the IV characteristics. If the coupling is\nstrong enough, the frequency of the cavity mode is greatly red-shifted from its\nuncoupled value. We present simple geometrical arguments which account for this\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2005 17:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
