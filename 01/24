The PHP relation has an intrinsic dispersion of ~32% in re, and turns\nout to be independent of waveband. This result is consistent with the fact that\ninternal colour gradients of ETGs can have only a mild dependence on galaxy\nluminosity (mass). There is no evidence for a significant curvature in the PHP.\nWe show that this can be explained if this relation origins from a systematic\nvariation of the specific entropy of ETGs along the galaxy sequence, as was\nsuggested from previous works. The intrinsic scatter of the PHP is\nsignificantly smaller than for other purely photometric relations, such as the\nKormendy relation and the photometric Fundamental Plane, which is constructed\nby using colours in place of velocity dispersions. The scatter does not depend\non the waveband and the residuals about the plane do not correlate with\nresiduals of the colour-magnitude relation. Finally, we compare the\ncoefficients of the PHP at z~0.3 with those of ETGs at z~0, showing that the\nPHP is a valuable tool to constrain the luminosity evolution of ETGs with\nredshift. The slopes of the PHP do not change significantly with redshift,\nwhile the zero-point is consistent with cosmological dimming of the surface\nbrightness in an expanding universe plus the passive fading of galaxy stellar\npopulations with a high formation redshift (z_f >1-2).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2005 12:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The particles\ninside the silo are imaged and tracked with unprecedented resolution in both\nspace and time to obtain their velocity and diffusion properties. The data\nobtained by varying the orifice width and the hopper angle allows us to\nthoroughly test models of gravity driven flows inside these geometries. All of\nour measured velocity profiles are smooth and free of the shock-like\ndiscontinuities (\"rupture zones\") predicted by critical state soil mechanics.\nOn the other hand, we find that the simple Kinematic Model accurately captures\nthe mean velocity profile near the orifice, although it fails to describe the\nrapid transition to plug flow far away from the orifice. The measured diffusion\nlength $b$, the only free parameter in the model, is not constant as usually\nassumed, but increases with both the height above the orifice and the angle of\nthe hopper. We discuss improvements to the model to account for the\ndifferences. From our data, we also directly measure the diffusion of the\nparticles and find it to be significantly less than predicted by the Void\nModel, which provides the classical microscopic derivation of the Kinematic\nModel in terms of diffusing voids in the packing. However, the experimental\ndata is consistent with the recently proposed Spot Model, based on a simple\nmechanism for cooperative diffusion. Finally, we discuss the flow rate as a\nfunction of the orifice width and hopper angles. We find that the flow rate\nscales with the orifice size to the power of 1.5, consistent with dimensional\nanalysis. Interestingly, the flow rate increases when the funnel angle is\nincreased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2005 15:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
