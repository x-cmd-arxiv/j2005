The relaxation of semiclassical black hole can be\ndescribed in terms of correlation function which exponentially decays with\ntime. In the momentum space it is represented by infinite set of complex poles\nto be identified with the quasi-normal modes. This behavior is in sharp\ncontrast to the relaxation in unitary theory in finite volume: correlation\nfunction of the perturbation in this case is quasi-periodic function of time\nand, in general, is expected to show the Poincar\\'e recurrences. In this paper\nwe demonstrate how restore unitarity in the BTZ black hole, the simplest\nexample of eternal black hole in finite volume. We start with reviewing the\nrelaxation in the semiclassical BTZ black hole and how this relaxation is\nmirrored in the boundary conformal field theory as suggested by the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. We analyze the sum over $SL(2,{\\bf Z})$ images of the BTZ\nspace-time and suggest that it does not produce a quasi-periodic relaxation, as\none might have hoped, but results in correlation function which decays by power\nlaw. We develop our earlier suggestion and consider a non-semiclassical\ndeformation of the BTZ space-time that has structure of wormhole connecting two\nasymptotic regions semiclassically separated by horizon. The small deformation\nparameter $\\lambda$ is supposed to have non-perturbative origin to capture the\nfinite N behavior of the boundary theory.

The theoretical calculations are based on a Relativistic\nBoltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck ($RBUU$) transport equation including stochastic\neffects. A Relativistic Mean Field ($RMF$) approach is used, based on a\nnon-linear Lagrangian, with coupling constants tuned to reproduce the high\ndensity results of calculations with correlations.\n  At variance with the case at Fermi energies, a new fast clusterization\nmechanism is revealed in the early compression stage of the reaction dynamics.\nFragments appear directly produced from phase-space fluctuations due to\ntwo-body correlations. In-medium effects of the elastic nucleon-nucleon cross\nsections on the fragmentation dynamics are particularly discussed. The\nsubsequent evolution of the primordial clusters is treated using a simple\nphenomenological phase space coalescence algorithm.\n  The reliability of the approach, formation and recognition, is investigated\nin detail by comparing fragment momentum space distributions {\\it and\nsimultaneously} their yields with recent experimental data of the $FOPI$\ncollaboration by varying the system size of the colliding system, i.e. its\ncompressional energy (pressure, radial flow). We find an excellent agreement\nbetween theory and experiment in almost all the cases and, on the other hand,\nsome limitations of the simple coalescence model. Furthermore, the temporal\nevolution of the fragment structure is explored with a clear evidence of an\nearlier formation of the heavier clusters, that will appear as interesting\n$relics$ of the high density phase of the nuclear Equation of State ($EoS$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2005 12:53:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2005 11:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
