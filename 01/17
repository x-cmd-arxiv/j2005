At higher redshifts, we observe the growth of SMBHs\nindirectly through identification of high redshift quasars. However information\non their hosts is difficult to obtain. In this paper we determine the masses of\nhalos that host high redshift quasars (at z>4) by comparing the rate of growth\nof quasar density with that predicted by the Press-Schechter mass function. The\nhost mass determined depends on how the ratio between SMBH and host halo mass\nevolves with redshift. Assuming the ratio between SMBH and halo mass does not\nevolve with redshift, we find a host halo mass of log(M)=11.7+/-0.3 solar\nmasses. Even if the quasars shine at their Eddington limit, this mass is\nsignificantly smaller than that seen in the local universe. Indeed the\nnull-hypothesis, of a constant SMBH to halo mass ratio at all redshifts, can be\nruled out at greater than a 5-sigma level. SMBHs must therefore have\ncontributed a larger fraction to the host mass in the past. Including redshift\nevolution of the SMBH to halo mass ratio, we find larger halo masses of\nlog(M)=12.4+/-0.3 solar masses, and a ratio between SMBH and halo mass that\nincreases with redshift as ~(1+z)^1.5 are required to be consistent with both\nlocal and high redshift observations. We investigate restrictions placed on the\ncritical linear overdensity of quasar hosts at their epoch of virialisation and\nfind that it cannot exceed the traditional value of delta_c=1.69 by more than a\nfactor of two.

The magnetic field dependence of the dot levels leads to a global shift of\nthe Fano lines which becomes important for small ring/dot area ratios. As the\nmagnetic field is varied the Fano dips move periodically from one side of the\npeak to the other, as reported by Kobayashi {\\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf\n88}, 256806 (2002)]. We show that this effect appears due to a specific\nmagnetic control of the difference between the phase of the single nonresonant\npath via the free arm of the ring and the global phase of all trajectories\ninvolving resonant tunnelings through the dot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2005 12:56:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2005 11:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

For completely specified\nstates, necessary and sufficient conditions on a quantum measurement minimizing\nthe probability of a detection error have been derived. In this work, we assume\nthat each of the states in our collection is a mixture of a known state and an\nunknown state. We investigate two criteria for optimality. The first is\nminimization of the worst-case probability of a detection error. For the second\nwe assume a probability distribution on the unknown states, and minimize of the\nexpected probability of a detection error.\n  We find that under both criteria, the optimal detectors are equivalent to the\noptimal detectors of an ``effective ensemble''. In the worst-case, the\neffective ensemble is comprised of the known states with altered prior\nprobabilities, and in the average case it is made up of altered states with the\noriginal prior probabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2005 07:21:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 May 2005 09:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In contrast with the geometric phase in dissipative systems, the\ngeometric phase acquired by the system can be observed on a long time scale.
