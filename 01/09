The focus is\nmostly on the impact of long-range van der Waals interactions both within the\nfluid and between the fluid and substrate. For the latter, we consider two\nmodels-hard wall and soft wall approximations-differing by the role of steric\neffects and leading to a qualitatively different character of phase\ntransitions. We compute numerically the disjoining and conjoining potentials\n(which are important dynamically for spreading, spinodal dewetting, and\ncoarsening in thin films, as well as resolution of interfacial singularities),\nand loci of intermediate and complete wetting transitions as functions of the\nHamaker constant and temperature. We find that taking into account short-range\ninteractions is essential for the description of wetting transitions in the\nsoft wall limit. We derive an analytical form of the disjoining potential and\nanalyze it in the context of the complete, frustrated and partial wetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2005 10:15:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2005 10:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}
