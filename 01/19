The recent discovery of a tight correlation between the collimation\ncorrected GRB energy and the peak of the gamma-ray spectrum has opened the\npossibility to use GRBs as a new category of standard candles. Unfortunately,\nbecause of the lack of low-z GRBs, up to now this correlation is obtained from\nhigh-z GRBs with the consequence that it depends on the cosmological parameters\nwe pretend to constrain. Hopefully this circularity problem will be solved\nwhen, in a few years, the low-z GRB sample will be increased enough. In the\nmeanwhile we present here a new Bayesian method that eases the aforesaid\ncircularity problem, and allows to introduce new constrains on the cosmological\n(Om,OL) diagram as well as to explore the universe kinematics up to z~3. The\nmethod we propose offers the further advantage to make handy the problem of the\n(Om,OL) loitering line singularity which inevitably appears when standard\ncandles with z>2 are used. The combination of GRB with SN Ia data makes the\npopular LambdaCDM cosmology more consistent with the Hubble diagram at a 68%\nconfidence level. For a flat cosmology we find Om=0.28\\pm0.03 for the combined\nGRB+SN Ia data set. Correspondingly, the transition redshift between cosmic\ndeceleration and acceleration is z_T=0.73\\pm0.09, slightly larger than the\nvalue found by considering SNe Ia alone. We briefly discuss our results also in\nterms of non--LambdaCDM dark energy models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2005 21:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We demonstrate that stellar halo\nand dwarf galaxy abundance patterns can be explained naturally within the LCDM\nframework. Our solution relies fundamentally on the LCDM model prediction that\nthe majority of the stars in the stellar halo were formed within a few\nrelatively massive, ~5 x 10^10 Msun, dwarf irregular (dIrr)-size dark matter\nhalos, which were accreted and destroyed ~10 Gyr in the past.

But the method generally has limited predictive power because of\nits reliance on predetermined atomic events and their energetics as input. We\npresent a novel method, within the lattice gas model in which we combine\nstandard KMC with automatic generation of a table of microscopic events,\nfacilitated by a pattern recognition scheme. Each time the system encounters a\nnew configuration, the algorithm initiates a procedure for saddle point search\naround a given energy minimum. Nontrivial paths are thus selected and the fully\ncharacterized transition path is permanently recorded in a database for future\nusage. The system thus automatically builds up all possible single and multiple\natom processes that it needs for a sustained simulation. Application of the\nmethod to the examination of the diffusion of 2-dimensional adatom clusters on\nCu(111) displays the key role played by specific diffusion processes and also\nreveals the presence of a number of multiple atom processes, whose importance\nis found to decrease with increasing cluster size and decreasing surface\ntemperature.

The\nmagnetoimpedance, MI (change of impedance of a ferromagnet on application of a\nfield) in 3-layered structures consisting of two magnetic layers separated by a\nnon-magnetic conductive layer has been predicted to show high MI. In many cases\nthe experimental values of MI effect are smaller than the theoretical\npredictions.

This allows us to study the phase structure of the\nquenched theory, and compare it to that in the unquenched theory. In particular\nwe study whether there may be an Aoki phase (with parity and flavor\nspontaneously broken) or a first order transition line (with no symmetry\nbreaking but meson masses proportional to the lattice spacing), which are the\ntwo possibilities in the unquenched theory. The presence of such phase\nstructure, and the concomitant long-range correlations, has important\nimplications for numerical studies using both quenched and dynamical overlap\nand domain-wall fermions. We argue that the phase structure is qualitatively\nthe same as in the unquenched theory, with the choice between the two\npossibilities depending on the sign of a parameter in the low-energy effective\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2005 02:30:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2005 22:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

S.-H. Wang,\nunpublished data used with the authors' permission). This happens for both long\nterm potentiation (LTP) and long term depression (LTD) induction protocols.\nO'Connor, Wittenberg, and Wang have argued that three states would account for\ntheir observations on individual synapses in the CA3-CA1 pathway. We develop a\nquantitative model of this three state system with transitions among the states\ndetermined by a competition between kinases and phosphatases shown by O'Connor\net al. to be determinant of LTP and LTD, respectively. Specific predictions for\nvarious plasticity protocols are given by coupling this description of discrete\nsynaptic AMPA conductance changes to a model of postsynaptic membrane potential\nand associated intracellular calcium fluxes to yield the transition rates among\nthe states. We then present various LTP and LTD induction protocols to the\nmodel system and report the resulting whole cell changes in AMPA conductance.\nWe also examine the effect of our discrete state synaptic plasticity model on\nthe synchronization of realistic oscillating neurons. We show that one-to-one\nsynchronization is enhanced by the plasticity we discuss here and the\npresynaptic and postsynaptic oscillations are in phase. Synaptic strength\nsaturates naturally in this model and does not require artificial upper or\nlower cutoffs, in contrast to earlier models of plasticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2005 21:09:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-26"}
