The\nhigh-resolution spectra were obtained at -9 and -2 days to allow the detection\nof narrow hydrogen and/or helium emission lines from the circumstellar medium\nof the SN. No such lines were detected, and we therefore use photoionisation\nmodels to derive upper limits of 9x10^-6 Msun/yr and 5x10^-5 Msun/yr for the\nmass loss rate from the progenitor system assuming velocities of 10 km/s and 50\nkm/s, respectively, for a wind extending to outside at least a few x 10^15 cm\naway from the SN explosion site. These limits exclude a symbiotic star in the\nupper mass loss rate regime from being the progenitor of SN 2001el. The low\nresolution spectrum was obtained in the nebular phase of the SN, 400 days after\nthe maximum light, to search for any hydrogen rich gas originating from the SN\nprogenitor system. However, we see no signs of Balmer lines in our spectrum.\nTherefore, we model the late time spectra to derive an upper limit of ~0.03\nMsun for solar abundance material present at velocities lower than 1000 km/s\nwithin the SN explosion site. According to simulations of Marietta et al.\n(2000) this is less than the expected mass lost by a subgiant, red giant or\nmain sequence secondary star at a small binary separation as a result of the SN\nexplosion.

Catalogs of these measurements are\npresented for 1642 galaxies brighter than F814W(AB)=23.0 . Galaxy luminosity\nprofiles are fitted with three models: exponential disk, de Vaucouleurs bulge,\nand a disk-plus-bulge hybrid model. The best fit is selected and produces a\nquantitative assessment of the morphology of each galaxy: the principal\nparameters derived being B/T, the ratio of bulge to total luminosity, the scale\nlengths and half-light radii, axial ratios, position angles and surface\nbrightnesses of each component. Cluster membership is determined using a\nstatistical correction for field galaxy contamination, and a mass normalization\nfactor (mass within boundaries of the observed fields) is derived for each\ncluster. In the present paper, this catalog of measurements is used to\ninvestigate the luminosity evolution of disk galaxies in the rich-cluster\nenvironment. Examination of the relations between disk scale-length and central\nsurface brightness suggests, under the assumption that these clusters represent\na family who share a common evolutionary history and are simply observed at\ndifferent ages, that there is a dramatic change in the properties of the small\ndisks (h < 2 kpc). This change is best characterized as a change in surface\nbrightness by about 1.5 magnitude between z=0.3 and z=0.8 with brighter disks\nat higher redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2005 22:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

However, recent theoretical and\nobservational work suggests that magnetic forces may appreciably torque the\ninner disk. This raises the question of the effect that a time-changing\nmagnetic torque may have on the evolution of such a disk. In particular, we\nexplore the suggestion that the ``Deep Minimum State'' of the Seyfert galaxy\nMCG--6-30-15 can be identified as a sporadic inner disk torquing event. This\nsuggestion is motivated by detailed analyses of changes in the profile of the\nbroad fluorescence iron line in XMM-Newton spectra. We find that the response\nof such a disk to a torquing event has two phases; an initial damming of the\naccretion flow together with a partial draining of the disk interior to the\ntorque location, followed by a replenishment of the inner disk as the system\nachieves a new (torqued) steady-state. If the Deep Minimum State of\nMCG--6-30-15 is indeed due to a sporadic torquing event, we show that the\nfraction of the dissipated energy going into X-rays must be smaller in the\ntorqued state.

To\nanalyze this phenomenon, we note that invaders often cluster spatially when\nrare, and consequently an introduced exotic's population dynamics should depend\non locally structured interactions. Ecological theory for spatially structured\ninvasion relies on deterministic approximations, and determinism does not\naddress the observed uncertainty of the exotic-introduction process. We take a\nnew approach to the population dynamics of invasion and, by extension, to the\ngeneral question of invasibility in any spatial ecology. We apply the physical\ntheory for nucleation of spatial systems to a lattice-based model of\ncompetition between plant species, a resident and an invader, and the analysis\nreaches conclusions that differ qualitatively from the standard ecological\ntheories. Nucleation theory distinguishes between dynamics of single-cluster\nand multi-cluster invasion. Low introduction rates and small system size\nproduce single-cluster dynamics, where success or failure of introduction is\ninherently stochastic. Single-cluster invasion occurs only if the cluster\nreaches a critical size, typically preceded by a number of failed attempts. For\nthis case, we identify the functional form of the probability distribution of\ntime elapsing until invasion succeeds. Although multi-cluster invasion for\nsufficiently large systems exhibits spatial averaging and almost-deterministic\ndynamics of the global densities, an analytical approximation from nucleation\ntheory, known as Avrami's law, describes our simulation results far better than\nstandard ecological approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2005 01:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

At the same time, our geometrical reconstruction procedure,\nconsidering only the ring-like structure of the Cherenkov image, gives an\nunsatisfactory resolution for 1GeV electron and muon, with a mean vertex\nposition error, delta r, of 5-10 m and a mean directional error, delta theta,\nof about 6-20 degrees. In contrast, a geometrical reconstruction procedure\nutilizing the full image and using a detailed approximation of the event\nangular distribution works much better: for a 1 GeV electron, delta r is about\n2 m and delta theta is about 3 degrees; for a 1GeV muon, delta r is about 3 m\nand delta theta is about 5 degrees. At 5 GeV, the corresponding values are\nabout 1.4 m and about 2 degree for electron and are about 2.9m and about 4.3\ndegrees for muon. The numerical values depend on a single PMT contribution\nthreshold. The values quoted above are the minima with respect to this\nthreshold.\n  Even the methodologically correct approach we have adopted, based on detailed\nsimulations using closer approximations than those adopted in the SK analysis,\ncannot reproduce the accuracies for particle discrimination, momentum\nresolution, interaction vertex location, and angular resolution obtained by the\nSK simulations, suggesting the assumptions in these may be inadequate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2005 10:25:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2007 09:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}
