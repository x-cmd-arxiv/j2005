For comparison purposes we also observed\nwith the same equipment both the classical T Tauri star HL Tau and the active\nlate-type star LDN 1551-9. The spectra of all three observed edge-on disks\nconsist of a T Tauri emission and absorption line spectrum with superimposed\njet emission lines. Analysis of the spectra confirmed that the disks are\ncompletely opaque at visible wavelengths and that light from the central\nobjects reaches us only via scattering layers above and below the disk planes.\nThe central objects of our targets were found to be normal T Tauri stars\nshowing moderate but different amounts of veiling of their photospheric\nspectra, indicating different accretion rates or evolutionary stages. We\nsuggest that all classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) show this observed morphology\nwhen viewed edge-on. Part of the jet emission from edge-on systems is directly\nvisible to us in the forbidden lines as well as in Halpha and He I, a finding\nwhich contradicts the present paradigm of a pure magnetospheric accretion\norigin for the formation of hydrogen and helium emission lines in moderately\nactive CTTSs. From a comparison with those Taurus-Auriga CTTSs for which the\ninclination is reliably known, we conclude that the view angle of CTTS systems\nis one of the key parameters governing apparent Halpha emission strength in the\nT Tauri class.

Here, we investigate\nin detail, the process of magnetic energy release in a situation where two\ninitially independent flux systems are forced into each other. Work done by the\nfoot point motions goes in to building a current sheet in which magnetic\nreconnection takes place. The scaling relations of the energy input and output\nare determined as functions of the driving velocity and the strength of fluxes\nin the independent flux systems. In particular, it is found that the energy\ninjected into the system is proportional to the distance travelled not the rate\nof travel. Similarly, the rate of Joule dissipation is related to the distance\ntravelled. Hence, rapidly driven foot points lead to bright, intense, but\nshort-lived events, whilst slowly driven foot points produce weaker, but\nlonger-lived brightenings. Integrated over the lifetime of the events both\nwould produce the same heating if all other factors were the same. A strong\noverlying field has the affect of creating compact flux lobes from the sources.\nThese appear to lead to a more rapid injection of energy, as well as a more\nrapid release of energy. Thus, the stronger the overlying field the more\ncompact and more intense the heating. This means observers must know the rate\nof movement of the magnetic fragments involved in an events, as well as\ndetermine the strength and orientation of the surrounding field to be able to\npredict anything about the energy dissipated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2005 12:52:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2005 10:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Most of the spectra have been taken with SUBARU IRCS,\nat a resolution of 12,000, and with a very high S/N (200 or better). In order\nto synthesize the strategic H/He lines, we have used our recent, line-blanketed\nversion of FASTWIND. First we investigated the predicted behaviour of the\nstrategic lines. In contradiction to what one expects from the optical in the\nO-star regime, almost all photospheric H/HeI/HeII H/K band lines become\nstronger if the gravity decreases.

However, this is not the\ncase if they ignore non-detection events because Eve can make use of the\ndetection-loophole, as Larrson showed. We show that even when legitimate users\ntake into account non-detection events Eve can successfully eavesdrop if the\nQKD system has been appropriately designed by the manufacturer. A loophole\nutilized here is that of `free-choice' (or `real randomness'). Local QKD\ndevices with pseudo-random sequence generator installed in them can apparently\nviolate Bell's inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2005 07:25:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2005 04:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
