The source was\ncontinuously variable, with a 30 % increase in luminosity in the second half of\nthe observation. No variability in the warm absorber was detected between the\nspectra from the first 170 ks and the second part of the observation. The\nvelocity structure of the X-ray absorber is consistent with the velocity\nstructure measured simultaneously in the ultraviolet spectra. We find that the\nhighest velocity outflow component, at -1040 km/s, becomes increasingly\nimportant for higher ionization parameters. This velocity component spans at\nleast three orders of magnitude in ionization parameter, producing both highly\nionized X-ray absorption lines (Mg XII, Si XIV) as well as UV absorption lines.\nA similar conclusion is very probable for the other four velocity components.\nBased upon our observations, we argue that the warm absorber probably does not\nmanifest itself in the form of photoionized clumps in pressure equilibrium with\na surrounding wind. Instead, a model with a continuous distribution of column\ndensity versus ionization parameter gives an excellent fit to our data. From\nthe shape of this distribution and the assumption that the mass loss through\nthe wind should be smaller than the accretion rate onto the black hole, we\nderive upper limits to the solid angle as small as 10^{-4} sr.

The density\nstratification across the stream then produces the wide range of ionization\nparameter observed in this source.

These experiments have yielded valuable\ninformation on the mixing angles and on the mass differences of the three\neigenstates but cannot determine the scale of the neutrino mass, which is fixed\nby the lightest neutrino mass eigenvalue. This can only be directly determined\nby kinematic measurementsor by the observation and measurement of the\nneutrinoless double-beta decay (NDBD) half-life. The CUORE experiment is\ndesigned with a sensitivity capable of probing the range indicated by\noscillation experiments. It consists of an array of 988, 750 g, TeO2 bolometers\noperating at 8 to 10 mK and arranged in a cylindrical geometry of 19 towers\nhanging on the bottom of the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator. Each\ntower consists of 13 4-detector modules for a total of 52 bolometers. One such\ntower has been successfully constructed and is now operated in the Gran Sasso\nLaboratory as a test experiment, and also as an independent NDBD experiment\ncalled CUORICINO. In fact, the 3 year half-life sensitivity of CUORICINO for\nNDBD decay of 130Te is 6.1E24 years. Thus far the CUORICINO data demonstrate\nthe technical feasibility of the expanded CUORE array while showing what and\nwhere the sources of background are and how to reduce them. A background\nreduction to 0.01 counts/keV/kg/y in the NDBD energy region is therefore\npossible. This would allow the full CUORE array to achieve a 5-year sensitivity\nof the order of 30 meV on the effective neutrino mass. Another order of\nmagnitude reduction (corresponding to a sensitivity of about 15 meV) will\npresent a real challenge, but is also possible.

It is found that above system also exhibits multiple\nattractors under different parameter values but same initial condition and we\nhave shown the existence of three other strange attractors with varying\ndimensionality under different parametric conditions. The properties of these\nattractors are then analyzed on the basis of Lyapunov exponents, power spectra,\nrecurrence analysis and peak-to-peak dynamics. The peak-to-peak dynamics relies\non the low dimensionality of the chaotic attractor and allows to approximately\nmodel the system. Peak-to-peak plot along with return-time plot are then\neffectively used to solve the optimal control problem of the system which\nreverts the system to a periodic situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2005 07:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The final\nshape of the deposit seems to depend only on the aspect ratio $a$ of the\ncolumns; these results are in good agreement with previous experimental work.\nIn particular, the renormalised runout distance shows a power law dependence on\nthe aspect ratio $a$, which is incompatible with a simple friction model. The\ndynamics of the collapse is shown to be mostly controlled by the free fall of\nthe column. The energy dissipation at the base of the column can be described\nsimply by a coefficient of restitution. Hence the energy available for the\nsideways flow is proportional to the initial potential energy $E_0$. The\ndissipation process within the flow is well approximated by basal friction,\ncontrary to the behaviour of the runout distance. The mass ejected sideways is\nshowned to play a determining role in the spreading process. As $a$ increases,\nthe same fraction of initial potential energy $E_0$ drives more mass against\nfriction. This additional dissipation give a possible explanation for power-law\ndependence of the runout distance on $a$. Beyond the frictional properties of\nthe material, we show that the flow characteristics strongly depend on the\nearly dynamics of the collapse. We propose a new scaling for the runout\ndistance that matches the data well, is compatible with a friction model, and\nprovide a qualitative explanation to the column collapse phenomenology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2005 19:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
