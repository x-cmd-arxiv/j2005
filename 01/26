The changing delay in the propagation of photons produces an\napparent deceleration of the planet across the sky throughout the transit. This\npersistent transverse deceleration breaks the time-reversal symmetry in the\ntransit lightcurve of a spherical planet in a circular orbit around a perfectly\nsymmetric star. For `hot Jupiter' systems, ingress advances at a higher rate\nthan egress by a fraction of 10^{-4}-10^{-3}. Forthcoming space telescopes such\nas Kepler or COROT will reach the sensitivity required to detect this\nasymmetry. The scaling of the fractional asymmetry with stellar mass M and\nplanetary orbital radius R as M/R^2 is different from the scaling of the\norbital period as (M/R^3)^{-1/2}. Therefore, this effect constitutes a new\nmethod for a purely dynamical determination of the mass of the star, which is\ncurrently inferred indirectly with theoretical uncertainties based on spectral\nmodeling.

The mass-radius relations of these systems' donors in the\nmass range of interest ($M_2<0.1 \\msun$) are not single-valued, but\nparameterized by the donor's specific entropy. This produces a range in the\nrelationships between system observables, such as orbital period, $\\Porb$, and\nmass transfer rate, $\\Mdot$. For a reasonable range in donor specific entropy,\n$\\Mdot$ can range over several orders of magnitude at fixed $\\Porb$. We\ndetermine the unique relation between $\\Mdot$ and $M_2$ in the AM CVn systems\nwith known donor to accretor mass ratios, $q=M_2/M_1$. We use structural\narguments, as well as each system's photometric behavior, to place limits on\n$\\Mdot$ and $M_2$ in each. Most systems allow a factor of about 3 variation in\n$\\Mdot$, although V803 Cen, if the current estimates of its $q$ are accurate,\nis an exception and must have $M_2 \\approx 0.02 \\msun$ and $\\Mdot \\approx\n10^{-10} \\msun$ yr$^{-1}$. Our donor models also constrain each donor's core\ntemperature, $T_c$, range and correlate $T_c$ with $M_2$. We examine how\nvariations in donor specific entropy across the white dwarf family\n\\citep{nele01a} of AM CVn systems affects this population's current galactic\ndistribution. Allowing for donors that are not fully degenerate produces a\nshift in systems towards longer $\\Porb$ and higher $\\Mdot$ increasing the\nparameter space in which these systems can be found. This shift increases the\nfraction of systems whose $\\Porb$ is long enough that their gravity wave (GW)\nsignal is obscured by the background of detached double white dwarf binaries\nthat dominate the GW spectrum below a frequency $\\approx 2$ mHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2005 14:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

These include macroscopic \"vacuum\" forces on a metallic layer\nin-between a dielectric medium and an inert ($\\epsilon (\\omega) = 1$) one. Ways\nto control the sign of these forces, based on dielectric properties of the\nmedia, are thus suggested. Finally, the large positive Casimir pressure, due to\nsurface plasmons on thin metallic layers, is evaluated and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2005 15:23:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2005 13:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
