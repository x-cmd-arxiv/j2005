The obtained data are used to establish a rich phase diagram centered\nat the \"parent'' compound GdBaCo_{2}O_{5.5} -- an insulator with Co ions in the\n3+ state. An attractive feature of GBCO is that it allows a precise and\ncontinuous doping of CoO_{2} planes with either electrons or holes, spanning a\nwide range from the charge-ordered insulator at 50% electron doping (x=0) to\nthe undoped band insulator (x=0.5), and further towards the heavily hole-doped\nmetallic state. This continuous doping is clearly manifested in the behavior of\nthermoelectric power which exhibits a spectacular divergence with approaching\nx=0.5, where it reaches large absolute values and abruptly changes its sign. At\nlow temperatures, the homogeneous distribution of doped carriers in GBCO\nbecomes unstable, and both the magnetic and transport properties point to an\nintriguing nanoscopic phase separation. We also find that throughout the\ncomposition range the magnetic behavior in GBCO is governed by a delicate\nbalance between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions,\nwhich can be easily affected by temperature, doping, or magnetic field,\nbringing about FM-AF transitions and a giant magnetoresistance (MR) phenomenon.\nAn exceptionally strong uniaxial anisotropy of the Co spins, which dramatically\nsimplifies the possible spin arrangements, together with the possibility of\ncontinuous ambipolar doping turn GBCO into a model system for studying the\ncompeting magnetic interactions, nanoscopic phase separation and accompanying\nmagnetoresistance phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2005 13:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this method, it is demonstrated that the transition to turbulence\ndepends on the relative magnitudes of the transverse gradient of the total\nmechanical energy which amplifies the disturbance and the energy loss from\nviscous friction which damps the disturbance, for given imposed disturbance.\nFor a given flow geometry and fluid properties, when the maximum of the\nfunction K (a function standing for the ratio of the gradient of total\nmechanical energy in the transverse direction to the rate of energy loss due to\nviscous friction in the streamwise direction) in the flow field is larger than\na certain critical value, it is expected that instability would occur for some\ninitial disturbances. In this paper, using the energy gradient analysis, the\nequation for calculating the energy gradient function K for plane Couette flow\nis derived. The result indicates that K reaches the maximum at the moving\nwalls. Thus, the fluid layer near the moving wall is the most dangerous\nposition to generate initial oscillation at sufficient high Re for given same\nlevel of normalized perturbation in the domain. The critical value of K at\nturbulent transition, which is observed from experiments, is about 370 for\nplane Couette flow when two walls move in opposite directions (anti-symmetry).\nThis value is about the same as that for plane Poiseuille flow and pipe\nPoiseuille flow (385-389). Therefore, it is concluded that the critical value\nof K at turbulent transition is about 370-389 for wall-bounded parallel shear\nflows which include both pressure (symmetrical case) and shear driven flows\n(anti-symmetrical case).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2005 04:01:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2005 08:53:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2007 13:34:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2010 10:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-08"}

Flow instability and turbulence transition have been\nchallenging subjects for fluid dynamics for a century. The critical condition\nof turbulent transition from theory and experiments differs largely from each\nother for Poiseuille flows. In this paper, a new mechanism of flow instability\nand turbulence transition is presented for parallel shear flows and the energy\ngradient theory of hydrodynamic instability is proposed. It is stated that the\ntotal energy gradient in the transverse direction and that in the streamwise\ndirection of the main flow dominate the disturbance amplification or decay. A\nnew dimensionless parameter K for characterizing flow instability is proposed\nfor wall bounded shear flows, which is expressed as the ratio of the energy\ngradients in the two directions. It is thought that flow instability should\nfirst occur at the position of Kmax which may be the most dangerous position.\nThis speculation is confirmed by Nishioka et al's experimental data. Comparison\nwith experimental data for plane Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille flow\nindicates that the proposed idea is really valid. It is found that the\nturbulence transition takes place at a critical value of Kmax of about 385 for\nboth plane Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille flow, below which no turbulence\nwill occur regardless the disturbance. More studies show that the theory is\nalso valid for plane Couette flows and Taylor-Couette flows between concentric\nrotating cylinders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2005 04:33:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2005 04:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

We propose a new modeling framework for gene\nregulatory networks, that combines the intuitive appeal of a qualitative\ndescription of gene states with a high flexibility in incorporating\nstochasticity in the duration of cellular processes. We apply our methods to\nthe regulatory network of the segment polarity genes, thus gaining novel\ninsights into the development of gene expression patterns. For example, we show\nthat very short synthesis and decay times can perturb the wild type pattern. On\nthe other hand, separation of timescales between pre- and posttranslational\nprocesses and a minimal prepattern ensure convergence to the wild type\nexpression pattern regardless of fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2005 22:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is shown that the existence of maximally\nsuperstrong correlated bits implies that all distributed computations can be\nperformed with a trivial amount of communication, i.e. with one bit. If one\nbelieves that Nature does not allow such a computational 'free lunch', then the\nresult in the Letter gives a reason why superstrong correlation are indeed not\npossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2005 20:51:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The atomic momentum\ndistribution resulting from the interaction with counterpropagating sigma_+ and\nsigma_- radiation which couples a J_g=2 <-> J_e=1 transition is measured via\nthe transversal beam profile. This transition exhibits a stable VSCPT dark\nstate formed by the two |J=2,m=+/-1> states, and a metastable dark state\ncontaining the |J=2,m=+/-2> and |J=2,m=0> states. The dynamics of the formation\nand decay of stable and metastable dark states is studied experimentally and\nnumerically and the finite lifetime of the metastable dark state is\nexperimentally observed.

We identify\ndynamic regimes of collective spin variables arising from nonlinear\nself-interactions that are different from the usual Josephson oscillations.
