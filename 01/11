However, while\nthese systems show an age sequence, they do not provide strong evidence of a\ncausal relationship. The W3/W4 Galactic star-forming complex suggests a\nthree-generation hierarchy: the supergiant shell structures correspond to the\noldest generation; these triggered the formation of IC 1795 in W3, the\nprogenitor of a molecular superbubble; which in turn triggered the current\nstar-forming episodes in the embedded regions W3-North, W3-Main, and W3-OH. We\npresent UBV photometry and spectroscopic classifications for IC 1795, which\nshow an age of 3 - 5 Myr. This age is intermediate between the reported 6 - 20\nMyr age of the supergiant shell system, and the extremely young ages (10^4 -\n10^5 yr) for the embedded knots of ultracompact HII regions, W3-North, W3-Main,\nand W3-OH. Thus, an age sequence is indeed confirmed for the entire W3/W4\nhierarchical system.

The gravitational\nwave contribution can be separated from the dominant CMB polarization created\nby density perturbations because it generates both E and B polarization modes,\nwhereas the density perturbations create only E polarization. The limits of our\nability to measure gravitational waves are thus determined by statistical and\nsystematic errors, foregrounds, and nonlinear evolution effects such as lensing\nof the CMB. Usually it is assumed that most foregrounds can be removed because\nof their frequency dependence, however Thomson scattering of the CMB quadrupole\nby electrons in the Galaxy or nearby structures shares the blackbody frequency\ndependence of the CMB. If the optical depth from these nearby electrons is\nanisotropic, the polarization generated can include B modes even without tensor\nperturbations. We estimate this effect for the Galactic disk and nearby\nextragalactic structures, and find that it contributes to the B polarization at\nthe level of ~(1--2)x10^-4\\mu K per logarithmic interval in multipole L for\nL<30. This is well below the detectability level even for a future CMB\npolarization satellite. Depending on its structure and extent, the Galactic\ncorona may be a source of B-modes comparable to the residual large-scale\nlensing B-mode after the latter has been cleaned using lensing reconstruction\ntechniques. For an extremely ambitious post-Planck CMB experiment, Thomson\nscattering in the Galactic corona is thus a potential contaminant of the\ngravitational wave signal; conversely, if the other foregrounds can be cleaned\nout, such an experiment might be able to constrain models of the corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2005 20:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

On\nlarge scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the `baryon\noscillations' that are predicted in CDM models.

Many unidentified extragalactic sources are certainly blazars, and\nit is the intention of this work to uncover gamma-ray blazars missed by\nprevious attempts. Until recently, searches for blazar counterparts to\nunidentified EGRET sources have focused on finding AGN that have 5-GHz radio\nflux densities S_5 near or above 1 Jy. However, the recent blazar\nidentification of 3EG J2006-2321 (S_5 = 260 mJy) and other work suggest that\ncareful studies of weaker flat-spectrum sources may be fruitful. In this\nspirit, error circles of 4 high-latitude unidentified EGRET sources have been\nsearched for 5-GHz sources. The gamma-ray sources are 3EG J1133+0033, 3EG\nJ1212+2304, 3EG J1222+2315, and 3EG J1227+4302. Within the error contours of\neach of the four sources are found 6 radio candidates; by observing the\npositions of the radio sources with the 0.81-m Tenagra II telescope it is\ndetermined that 14 of these 24 radio sources have optical counterparts with R <\n22. Eight of these from two different EGRET sources have been observed in the\nB, V, and R bands in more than one epoch and the analysis of these data is\nongoing.

We demonstrate that this RG approach reproduces the\ncritical distribution of the power transmission coefficients, i.e.,\ntwo-terminal conductances, P_c(G), with very high accuracy. The RG flow of P(G)\nyields a value of the critical exponent nu that agrees with most accurate\nlarge-size lattice simulations. A description of how to obtain other relevant\ntransport coefficients such as R_L and R_H is given. From the non-trivial fixed\npoint of the RG flow we extract the critical level-spacing distribution (LSD)\nwhich is close, but distinctively different from the earlier large-scale\nsimulations. We find that the LSD obeys scaling behavior around the QH\ntransition with nu=2.37\\pm 0.02. Away from the transition it changes towards\nthe Poisson distribution. We next investigate the plateau-to-insulator\ntransition. For a fully quantum coherent situation, we find a quantized Hall\ninsulator with R_H ~ h/e^2 up to R_L ~ 20 h/e^2 when interpreting the results\nin terms of the most probable value of the distribution P(R_H). Upon further\nincreasing R_L, the Hall insulator with diverging R_H ~ R_L^kappa is seen. This\ncrossover depends on the precise nature of the averaging of P(R_L) and P(R_H).\nWe also study the effect of long-ranged inhomogeneities on the critical\nproperties of the QH transition modeled by a power law correlation in the\nrandom potential. Similar to the classical percolation, we observe an\nenhancement of nu with decreasing correlation range. These results exemplify\nthe surprising fact that a small RG unit, containing five nodes, accurately\ncaptures most of the correlations responsible for the QH transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2005 11:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Both\ntheoretical analysis and experimental results show that, among a number of\nalternative ways to organize the additional information, the 4-level tree index\nprovides the best frequency estimation inside a bucket. The index is later\nadded to two well-known histograms, MaxDiff and V-Optimal, obtaining the\nnon-obvious result that despite the spatial cost of 4LT which reduces the\nnumber of allowed buckets once the storage space has been fixed, the original\nmethods are strongly improved in terms of accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2005 10:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

String theory's successes also include\npredicting both gauge theory and fermions. The difficulty of extra dimensions\nbecomes a possible virtue, when one notes that these lead to mechanisms to\nexplain fermion generations, as well as a means to break the large gauge\nsymmetries of string theory. Finally, a long standing problem of string theory,\nthat of fixing the size and shape of the extra dimensions, has recently been\naddressed and may shed light on the origin of the cosmological constant, the\nultimate fate of our universe, as well as the question of why gravity_is_ so\nweak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2005 01:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A Gedanken\nexperiment is considered in which kinetic energy from observed photons is\nsystematically removed until a limit of zero is reached. With the help of the\nrelativistic Doppler effect it is shown that even for infinitesimally small\nkinetic energies the photons continue to exist, since in other inertial systems\nthey will be observed to have a much higher energy/frequency falling in an\neasily detectable range. It is possible to formulate an alternative explanation\nfor absorption and emission processes on this basis in terms of real photons\nwith exactly zero kinetic energy being present before or after radiative\ninteractions. Bolstering this hypothesis is the fact that the statistical\nmechanical treatment of photons interacting with oscillators in blackbody\nradiation theory predicts an infinite density of photons of this energy, both\nin the original Planck formulation employing Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and\nin the subsequent Bose-Einstein description. These considerations demonstrate\nthat the E = 0 state is greatly preferred as the product of absorption because\nof the requirement to have the interaction occur in a relatively narrow region\nof space- time. There is thus strong evidence that photons are not created and\nannihilated in radiative processes but simply have their kinetic energy changed\neither to or from a zero value. Accordingly a very high density of zero-energy\nphotons is expected to exist uniformly throughout the universe. Finally, this\ndevelopment suggests that one should subject the creation-annihilation\nhypothesis to careful scrutiny in other areas of physics as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2005 09:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

In particular, we\nshow that an efficient quantum algorithm for a restricted version of the\noptimal measurement would imply an efficient quantum algorithm for the subset\nsum problem, and conversely, that the ability to quantum sample from subset sum\nsolutions allows one to implement the optimal measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2005 20:58:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2005 17:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-02"}
