In both states, non-sinusoidal\nphotometric modulations are apparent, suggestive of superhumps, placing SDSS\nJ2100 in the SU UMa subclass of dwarf novae. However, the periods during\noutburst and quiescence differ significantly, being 2.099 plus or minus 0.002\nhr and 1.96 plus or minus 0.02 hr respectively. Our phase-resolved spectroscopy\nduring outburst yielded an estimate of about 2 hr for the orbital period,\nconsistent with the photometry. The presence of the shorter period modulation\nat quiescence is unusual, but not unique. Another atypical feature is the\nrelative weakness of the Balmer emission lines in quiescence. Overall, we find\na close similarity between SDSS J2100 and the well-studied superhump\ncataclysmic Variable V503 Cygni. By analogy, we suggest that the quiescent\nmodulation is due to a tilted accretion disk -- producing negative superhumps\n-- and the modulation in outburst is due to positive superhumps from the\nprecession of an elliptical disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2005 20:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Such polymers are particularly interesting as \"dynamic coating\"\nmatrices for bio-separations, especially for DNA sequencing, capillary\nelectrophoresis and lab-on-chips. Separation performances are increased by\ncoating the inner surface of the capillaries with neutral polymers. This method\nallows to screen the surface charges, thus to prevent electro-osmosis flow and\nadhesion of charged macromolecules (e.g. proteins) on the capillary walls. We\nidentify three adsorption regimes: a \"mushroom\" regime, in which the coating is\nformed by strongly adsorbed skeleton loops and the side-chains anchored on the\nskeleton are in a swollen state, a \"brush\" regime, characterized by a uniform\nmulti-chains coating with an extended layer of non-adsorbing side-chains and a\nnon-adsorbed regime. By using a combination of mean field and scaling\napproaches, we explicitly derive asymptotic forms for the monomer concentration\nprofiles, for the adsorption free energy and for the thickness of the adsorbed\nlayer as a function of the skeleton and side-chains sizes and of the adsorption\nparameters. Moreover, we obtain the scaling laws for the transitions between\nthe different regimes.

In particular, we focus on\nthe allowed couplings of charged hypermultiplets in the lowest dimensional reps\nof the gauge groups SU(5), SO(10) and E(6). Our results are within the\nclassification of homogeneous quaternionic scalar manifolds. In the minimal\ncoupling of a generation of bulk matter hypermultiplets, supergravity requires\nthe field content of an SO(10) scenario. In the minimal coupling of $n$ bulk\ngenerations of matter and higgs hypermultiplets, supergravity requires the\nfield content of an E(6) scenario.\n  We also discuss the coupling of tensors and non-compact gaugings in 5D\nYMESGTs, which can serve as alternative ways to obtain four-dimensional Higgs\nsectors. Charged tensor couplings seem to be difficult to work with\nphenomenologically since a U(1) gauge factor is always required when they are\npresent, and it is not clear if tensors can be put in unified multiplets with\nother fields, if this is desired. This seems to imply that tensor coulpings in\nGUT scenarios may be better suited in higher dimensional settings.

The quantity sumPI has been emerging through a line of research on\nquantum query complexity lower bounds via the so-called quantum adversary\nmethod [Amb02, Amb03, BSS03, Zha04, LM04], culminating in [SS04] with the\nrealization that these many different formulations are in fact equivalent.\nGiven that sumPI turns out to be such a robust invariant of a function, we\nbegin to investigate this quantity in its own right and see that it also has\napplications to classical complexity theory.\n  As a surprising application we show that sumPI^2(f) is a lower bound on the\nformula size, and even, up to a constant multiplicative factor, the\nprobabilistic formula size of f. We show that several formula size lower bounds\nin the literature, specifically Khrapchenko and its extensions [Khr71, Kou93],\nincluding a key lemma of [Has98], are in fact special cases of our method.\n  The second quantity we introduce, maxPI(f), is always at least as large as\nsumPI(f), and is derived from sumPI in such a way that maxPI^2(f) remains a\nlower bound on formula size. While sumPI(f) is always a lower bound on the\nquantum query complexity of f, this is not the case in general for maxPI(f). A\nstrong advantage of sumPI(f) is that it has both primal and dual\ncharacterizations, and thus it is relatively easy to give both upper and lower\nbounds on the sumPI complexity of functions.
