We work in a supersymmetric scenario consisting of the minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model particle content, extended by the addition of\nthree heavy right handed Majorana neutrinos and their supersymmetric partners,\nand where the generation of neutrino masses is done via the seesaw mechanism.\nWithin this context, a significant lepton flavor mixing is generated in the\nslepton sector due to the Yukawa neutrino couplings, which is transmited from\nthe high to the low energies via the renormalization group equations. This\nslepton mixing then generates via loops of supersymmetric particles significant\ncontributions to the rates of $l_j \\to 3 l_i$ and the correlated $l_j \\to l_i\n\\gamma$ decays. We analize here in full detail these rates in terms of the\nrelevant input parameters, which are the usual minimal supergravity parameters\nand the seesaw parameters. For the $l_j \\to 3 l_i$ decays, a full one-loop\nanalytical computation of all the contributing supersymmetric loops is\npresented. This completes and corrects previous computations in the literature.\nIn the numerical analysis compatibility with the most recent experimental upper\nbounds on all these $\\tau$ and $\\mu$ decays, with the neutrino data, and with\nthe present lower bounds on the supersymmetric particle masses are required.\nTwo typical scenarios with degenerate and hierarchical heavy neutrinos are\nconsidered.

Generally, models based on the compact E6 seem to always include\ndoubly the degrees of freedom that we need physically. In this paper, we\npropose one solution to this problem. A basic idea is that: `we regard that\neach point of space-time corresponds to the center of projection of two\nfundamental figures (i.e. two internal structures), and assume that the\nprojection of these fundamental figures from each point possesses one\ntransformation group as a whole.' Namely, we put emphasis on the `analogy' with\nthe projective geometry. Given that the whole symmetry is compact E6 * Gauge,\nthe space $(\\Vec{\\mathfrak{J}_H} \\oplus i \\Vec{H^3}) \\times \\Vec{\\mathcal{G}}$\nis promising as two subspaces seen from such a viewpoint. When this situation\nis seen from the standpoint of Klein's Erlangen Program, each fundamental\nfigure should also have an independent transformation group. The symmetry\ncorresponding to this is Sp(4,H)/Z_2 * Gauge. This is ensured by the\nintroduction of the Yokota mapping Y. As a consequence, we result in the\npicture of interacting pair universes which are being pi/2[rad]-phase-shifted.\nThis picture is applicable to all the models based on the compact E6, which may\nbe not only matrix models but also field theories. An interacting\nbi-Chern-Simons model is provided when this result is applied to our previous\nmatrix model.

The problem is that the angle is a multivalued or\ndiscontinuous variable on the corresponding phase space. The remedy is to\nreplace phi by the smooth periodic functions cos phi and sin phi. In the case\nof the canonical pair (phi,l),l: orbital angular momentum (OAM), the phase\nspace S_(phi,l) ={phi in R mod 2pi, l in R} has the global structure S^1 x R of\na cylinder on which the Poisson brackets of the 3 functions cos phi, sin phi\nand l obey the Lie algebra of the euclidean group E(2) in the plane. This\nproperty provides the basis for the quantization of the system in terms of\nirreducible unitary representations of the group E(2) or of its covering\ngroups. A crucial point is that - due to the fact that the subgroup SO(2) = S^1\nis multiply connected - these representations allow for fractional OAM l = n +\nc, c in [0,1). Such c not 0 have already been observed in cases like the\nAharonov-Bohm and the fractional quantum Hall effects and they correspond to\nthe quasi-momenta of Bloch waves in ideal crystals. The proposal of the present\npaper is to look for fractional OAM in connection with the quantum optics of\nLaguerre-Gaussian laser modes in external magnetic fields.
