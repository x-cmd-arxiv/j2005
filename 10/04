All relations\nconstructed from emission-weighted mean temperature and intracluster medium\nmass, X-ray luminosity, isophotal size, or near-IR luminosity show a separation\nbetween cool core (CC) and non-cool core (NCC) clusters. We attribute this\npartially to a temperature bias in CC clusters, and partially to other cool\ncore-related structural changes. We attempt to minimize CC/NCC separation in\nscaling relations by applying a uniform scale factor to CC cluster temperatures\nand determining the scale factor for each relation that minimizes the\nseparation between CC and NCC populations, and by introducing central surface\nbrightness as a third parameter in relations. The latter approach reduces\nscatter in relations more than temperature scaling. We compare the scatter\nwithin subsamples split by CC/NCC and morphological merger indicators. CC\nclusters and clusters with less substructure generally exhibit higher scatter\nabout relations. The larger structural variations in CC clusters exit well\noutside the core, suggesting that a process more global than core radiative\ninstability is at work. Simulations without cooling mechanisms also show no\ncorrelation between substructure and larger scatter about relations, indicating\nthat any merger-related scatter increases are subtle. The results indicate that\ncool core related phenomena, not merging processes, are the primary contributor\nto scatter in scaling relations.

A peculiarity of this\nsystem is that the tunneling couplings which inject electrons and those which\ncollect them on the substrate are highly asymmetrical. A quantum dot model is\nused, coupling a single electronic level to a local phonon, forming polaron\nlevels. A \"half-shuttle\" mechanism is also introduced. A quantum kinetic\nformulation allows to derive rate equations. Assuming asymmetric tunneling\nrates, and in the absence of the half-shuttle coupling, negative differential\nconductance is obtained for a wide range of parameters. A detailed explanation\nof this phenomenon is provided, showing that NDC is maximal for intermediate\nelectron-phonon coupling. In addition, in absence of a gate, the \"floating\"\nlevel results in two distinct lengths for the current plateaus, related to the\ncapacitive couplings at the two junctions. It is shown that the \"half-shuttle\"\nmechanism tends to reinforce the negative differential regions, but it cannot\ntrigger this behavior on its own.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2005 09:14:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2006 10:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We show that the use of the generalized\ndynamical equation, which allows one to take into account that effective\nactions in quantum field theory, arising after integrating out certain degrees\nof freedom, are generally nonlocal, provides a new way to formulate the\neffective theory of nuclear forces. In this way we construct the most general\npossible operator describing the short-range part of the NN interaction in the\n1S0 channel. In particular, this operator can be incorporated into the chiral\npotential model. This is shown to provide an extension of the standard chiral\napproach. Being equivalent to the chiral potential model for some values of the\nconstants characterizing the short-range of the NN interaction this approach\nallows the solutions that cannot be reproduced by any potential model. In this\nway we find that for certain values of the constants inconsistent with\npotentials models the effect of the short-range forces on the half off-shell 2N\nT-matrix with high off-shell momenta grows in magnitude rapidly as the kinetic\nenergy of outgoing protons decreases at laboratory energies below 15 MeV.

The state of a system which starts in an instantaneous\neigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian is written as a power series which has a\nstraightforward diagrammatic representation. Each term of the series\ncorresponds to a sequence of \"adiabatic\" evolutions, during which the system\nremains in an instantaneous eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, punctuated by\ntransitions from one state to another. The first term of this series is the\nstandard adiabatic evolution, the next is the well-known first correction to\nit, and subsequent terms can be written down essentially by inspection.\nAlthough the final result is perhaps not terribly surprising, it seems to be\nnot widely known, and the interpretation is new, as far as we know. Application\nof the method to the adiabatic approximation is given, and some discussion of\nthe validity of this approximation is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2005 22:24:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2006 15:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
