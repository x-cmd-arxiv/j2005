We use hierarchical structure formation simulations to explore\nthe kinematics and spatial distribution of these early star-forming structures\nin galaxy haloes today. Most of the proto-galaxies rapidly merge, their stellar\ncontents and dark matter becoming smoothly distributed and forming the inner\nGalactic halo. The metal-poor globular clusters and old halo stars become\ntracers of this early evolutionary phase, centrally biased and naturally\nreproducing the observed steep fall off with radius. The most outlying peaks\nfall in late and survive to the present day as satellite galaxies. The observed\nradial velocity dispersion profile and the local radial velocity anisotropy of\nMilky Way halo stars are successfully reproduced in this model. If this epoch\nof structure formation coincides with a suppression of further cooling into\nlower sigma peaks then we can reproduce the rarity, kinematics and spatial\ndistribution of satellite galaxies as suggested by Bullock et al. (2000).\nReionisation at z=12+/-2 provides a natural solution to the missing satellites\nproblem. Measuring the distribution of globular clusters and halo light on\nscales from galaxies to clusters could be used to constrain global versus local\nreionisation models. If reionisation occurs contemporary, our model predicts a\nconstant frequency of blue globulars relative to the host halo mass, except for\ndwarf galaxies where the average relative frequencies become smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2005 20:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In order to perform a\nreliable extrapolation in the inverse radius, the calculations have been\ncarried out for nuclei with huge numbers of nucleons, of the order of 10^6. The\nCoulomb interaction has been ignored to be able to approach nuclei of arbitrary\nsizes and to avoid radial instabilities characteristic of systems with very\nlarge atomic numbers. The main contribution to the fluctuating part of the\nbinding energy has been removed using the Green's function method to calculate\nthe shell correction. The limitations of applying the leptodermous expansion to\nactual nuclei are discussed. While the leading terms in the macroscopic energy\nexpansion can be extracted very precisely, the higher-order, isospin-dependent\nterms are prone to large uncertainties due to finite-size effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2005 20:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

All\naxioms, except the one that expresses the uncertainty principle, are shared\nwith the classical event space. The only models for the set of axioms are\nlattices of subspaces of inner product spaces over a field K. (b) Another axiom\ndue to Soler forces K to be the field of real, or complex numbers, or the\nquaternions. We suggest a probabilistic reading of Soler's axiom. (c) Gleason's\ntheorem fully characterizes the probability measures on the algebra of events,\nso that Born's rule is derived. (d) Gleason's theorem is equivalent to the\nexistence of a certain finite set of rays, with a particular orthogonality\ngraph (Wondergraph). Consequently, all aspects of quantum probability can be\nderived from rational probability assignments to finite \"quantum gambles\". We\napply the approach to the analysis of entanglement, Bell inequalities, and the\nquantum theory of macroscopic objects. We also discuss the relation of the\npresent approach to quantum logic, realism and truth, and the measurement\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2005 09:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
