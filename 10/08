We generalize their method in two ways\nso as to determine whether multipole models can explain highly anomalous\nsystems. We carry the multipole expansion to higher order, and also include\nexternal tidal shear as a free parameter. Fitting for the shear proves crucial\nto finding a physical (positive-definite density) model. For B1422+231, working\nto order k = 5 (and including shear) yields a model that is physical but\nimplausible. Going to higher order (k >~ 9) reduces global departures from\nellipticity at the cost of introducing small scale wiggles near the bright\nimages. These localized undulations are more pronounced in B2045+265, where k ~\n17 multipoles are required to smooth out large scale deviations from elliptical\nsymmetry. Such modes surely cannot be taken at face value; they must indicate\nthat the models are trying to reproduce some other sort of structure.

The resonant Raman profile\nof this excitation, the polarization selection rules and the presence of its\novertone in resonance conditions allowed us to conclude that the origin of this\nfeature is magnetic.

In this paper, we\ntreat quantum amplitudes for the case of fermionic massless spin-1/2 (neutrino)\nfinal boundary data; working in the holomorphic representation, we take these\nboundary data to be odd elements of a Grassmann algebra. Making use of boundary\nconditions originally developed for local supersymmetry, we find that this\nfermionic case can be treated in a way which parallels the bosonic case. With\nthese boundary conditions, for $\\theta > 0$, one obtains a unique fermionic\nclassical solution, and we calculate its classical action as a functional of\nthe fermionic data on the late-time surface $\\Sigma_F$; the quantum amplitude\nfollows straightforwardly from this.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2005 10:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

The axioms give a complete theory of measurements in the sense of\nHaag and Kastler, taking the traditional form of a logic of propositions\nprovided with a classical spectral theorem. The results are expressed in terms\nof probability distributions of individual measurements. As applications, we\ngive a separation theorem for states by the set of observables and discuss its\nrelationship to the equivalence of ensembles in the thermodynamic-limit\nprogram. We also introduce a weak equivalence of states based on the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2005 06:37:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The distribution of such\nstate over cells, however, is not only a result of intracellular stochastic\nprocess, but is also influenced by the growth in cell numbers that depends on\nthe state. By incorporating the growth-death process into the standard\nFokker--Planck equation for the probability distribution, a nonlinear temporal\nevolution equation of distribution is obtained that includes a self-consistent\ngrowth term. The derived equation is generally solved analytically by means of\neigenfunction expansions. By focusing on the case with linear relaxation, two\nexamples are considered as applications of the proposed general formalism.\nFirst, by assuming that the growth rate of a cell increases linearly with the\nstate value $x$, the shift of the average state value $x$ due to the growth\neffect is shown to be proportional to the variance of the state $x$ and the\nrelaxation time, similarly with the biological fluctuation- response\nrelationship. Second, when there is a gap in the growth rate at some threshold\nvalue for the state $x$, existence of a critical gap value is demonstrated,\nbeyond which the average growth rate starts to increase. This critical value is\nagain obtained in terms of the relaxation time and the variance of $x$, all of\nwhich are experimentally measurable quantities. The relevance of the results to\nthe analysis of biological data on the distribution of cell states, as obtained\nfor example by flow cytometry, is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2005 17:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Various methods can be used to determine when to\nstop training in artificial neural networks: 1) early stopping based on\ncross-validation, 2) stopping after a analyst defined error is reached or after\nthe error levels off, 3) use of a test data set. We do not recommend the third\nmethod as the test data set is then not independent of model development. Many\nstudies used the testing data to optimize the model and training.

The importance\nof an independent data set cannot be overemphasized as we found dramatic\ndifferences in model accuracy assessed with prediction accuracy on the training\ndata set, as estimated with bootstrapping, and from use of an independent data\nset. The comparison of the artificial neural network with a general linear\nmodel (GLM) as a standard procedure is recommended because a GLM may perform as\nwell or better than the MLP. MLP models should not be treated as black box\nmodels but instead techniques such as sensitivity analyses, input variable\nrelevances, neural interpretation diagrams, randomization tests, and partial\nderivatives should be used to make the model more transparent, and further our\necological understanding which is an important goal of the modelling process.\nBased on our experience we discuss how to build a MLP model and how to optimize\nthe parameters and architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2005 19:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-29"}

We briefly review two main derivations of the\nLifshitz formula in the framework of thermal quantum field theory without use\nof the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A set of special conditions is\nformulated under which these derivations remain valid in the presence of\ndissipation. The low-temperature behavior of the Casimir and van der Waals\ninteractions between dissimilar dielectrics is found analytically from the\nLifshitz theory for both an idealized model of dilute dielectrics and for real\ndielectrics with finite static dielectric permittivities. The free energy,\npressure and entropy of the Casimir and van der Waals interactions at low\ntemperatures demonstrate the same universal dependence on the temperature as\nwas previously discovered for ideal metals. The entropy vanishes when\ntemperature goes to zero proving the validity of the Nernst heat theorem. This\nsolves the long-standing problem on the consistency of the Lifshitz theory with\nthermodynamics in the case of dielectric plates.
