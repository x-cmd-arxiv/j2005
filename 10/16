This takes typically several\nGyr. Such an age is sufficient for the initially more massive component to\ndeplete hydrogen in its core and to fill the Roche lobe. As a result, mass\ntransfer occurs with a reversal of the mass ratio. After a fast mass exchange\nthe present primaries of W UMa-type binaries land close to ZAMS whereas the\nsecondaries develop small helium cores, which makes them considerably\nover-sized relative to ZAMS stars of the same mass. As a result, both\ncomponents can fulfill the mass-radius relation for contact systems while being\nin thermal equilibrium. This solves the \"Kuiper paradox\". Further mass transfer\nin a contact phase proceeds on a nuclear time scale of the secondary. Hydrogen\nrich matter is transferred to the primary in the first part of this phase. This\nkeeps the primary close to ZAMS. When the mass of the secondary decreases below\nthe mass of the original hydrogen-burning core, helium-rich matter is\ntransferred to the primary shifting it towards TAMS. This prediction agrees\nwith observations of the position of the components of contact binaries on the\nmass-radium diagram.

In addition to the quasiparticle\nexcitations, here spin waves or magnons, this magnetic system admits a family\nof vortex solutions carrying two topological invariants, the winding number or\nvorticity, and the polarization. A vortex is approximately described as a\nparticle moving about the system, endowed with an effective mass and acted upon\nby a variety of forces. Classically, the vortex has an inter-vortex potential\nenergy giving a Coulomb-like force (attractive or repulsive depending on the\nrelative vortex vorticity), and a gyrotropic force, behaving as a self-induced\nLorentz force, whose direction depends on both topological indices. Expanding\nsemiclassically about a many-vortex solution, the vortices are quantized by\nconsidering the scattered magnon states, giving a zero point energy correction\nand a many-vortex mass tensor. The vortices cannot be described as independent\nparticles--that is, there are off-diagonal mass terms, such as 1/2 Mij vi vj,\nthat are non-negligible. This thesis examines the full vortex dynamics in\nfurther detail by evaluating the Feynman-Vernon influence functional, which\ndescribes the evolution of the vortex density matrix after the magnon modes\nhave been traced out. In addition to the set of forces already known, we find\nnew damping forces acting both longitudinally and transversely to the vortex\nmotion. The vortex motion within a collective cannot be entirely separated:\nthere are damping forces acting on one vortex due to the motion of another. The\neffective damping forces have memory effects: they depend not only on the\ncurrent motion of the vortex collection but also on the motion history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2005 04:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
