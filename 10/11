(2003). We extend these models by considering the temporal\nand spatial evolution of the energy distribution of relativistic electrons as\nthey advect downstream from their shock acceleration site. The energy spectrum\nevolves significantly due to the strength of inverse-Compton (IC) cooling in\nthese systems, and a full numerical evaluation of the synchrotron emission and\nabsorption coefficients is made. We have demonstrated that the geometry of the\nWCR and the streamlines of the flow within it lead to a spatially dependent\nbreak frequency in the synchrotron emission. We therefore do not observe a\nsingle, sharp break in the synchrotron spectrum integrated over the WCR, but\nrather a steepening of the synchrotron spectrum towards higher frequencies. We\nalso observe that emission from the wind-collision region (WCR) may appear\nbrightest near the shocks, since the impact of IC cooling on the non-thermal\nelectron distribution is greatest near the contact discontinuity (CD). We show\nthat the thermal emission from a CWB can mimic a thermal plus non-thermal\ncomposite spectrum if the thermal emission from the WCR becomes comparable to\nthat from the unshocked winds, and obtain a number of insights relevant to\nmodels of closer systems such as WR140. Finally, we apply our new models to the\nvery wide system WR147. The acceleration of non-thermal electrons appears to be\nvery efficient in our models of WR147, and we suggest that the shock structure\nmay be modified by feedback from the accelerated particles.

We have mapped the emission of the\nSiO(2-1) and H13CO+(1-0) lines in a 0.9kpcx1.3kpc region around the nucleus of\nIC342. The bulk of the line emission comes from a 290pc spiral arm and a r~80pc\nnuclear ring. The distribution of SiO clouds is mostly anticorrelated with the\ncontinuum emission at 87GHz, dominated by thermal free-free bremsstrahlung. The\nSiO/H13CO+ intensity ratio increases by an order of magnitude from the nuclear\nring to the spiral arm. Furthermore the gas kinematics show significant\ndifferences between SiO and H13CO+ over the spiral arm, where the linewidths of\nSiO are 2 times larger than that of H13CO+. The average abundance of SiO in the\ninner r~320pc, X(SiO)>2x10^{-10}, evidences that shock chemistry is at work in\nIC342.

The significant difference of the\nX(SiO) measured between the spiral arm (~a few 10^{-9}) and the nuclear ring\n(~10^{-10}) is not echoed by a comparable variation in the SiO/CH3OH intensity\nratio. This implies that the typical shock velocities should be similar in both\nregions. In contrast, the fraction of shocked molecular gas should be 5-7 times\nlarger in the spiral arm (up to ~10% of the available molecular gas mass over\nthe arm region) compared to the nuclear ring. We conclude that the large-scale\nshocks revealed by the SiO map of IC342 are mostly unrelated with star\nformation and arise instead in a pre-starburst phase.

Spectral study of these two components was performed evaluating\ntheir hardness ratios, used also to derive photon indices. Slow components are\nfound generally softer than the fast ones suggesting that their origin is\nlikely different. Being typical photon indices lower than those of the\nafterglows there is no evidence that the emission processes are similar.\nAnother interesting possibility is that slow components can be related to the\npresence of a hot photosphere having a thermal spectrum with kT around a few\nkeV superposed to a rapid variable non-thermal emission of the fast component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2005 14:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-11"}

The full-Sun spectrum shows\nenhanced emission in the wings, and is well described by a double Gaussian fit\nwith a narrow and a broad component. It is shown that the broad component is\ndue to structures on the solar surface, especially those related to the\nmagnetic chromospheric network. Thus it is proposed that the broad components\nof other solar-like stars are also a consequence of the mixture of surface\nstructures, and not necessarily a signature of small-scale heating processes\nlike explosive events, as it is commonly argued.

The aim of the present\nwork is to get analytical expressions describing the nonlinear dynamical\nproperties of the oscillator in noncontact and intermittent contact situations\nin the tapping mode. Three situations are investigated: the pure attractive\ninteraction, the pure repulsive interaction, and a mixing of the two. The\nanalytical solutions obtained allow general trends to be extracted: the\nnoncontact and the intermittent contact show a very discriminate variation of\nthe phase. Therefore the measurement of the phase becomes a simple way to\nidentify whether or not the tip touches the surface during the oscillating\nperiod. It is also found that the key parameter governing the structure of the\ndynamical properties is the product of the quality factor by a reduced\nstiffness. In the attractive regime, the reduced stiffness is the ratio of an\nattractive effective stiffness and the cantilever one. In the repulsive regime,\nthe reduced stiffness is the ratio between the contact stiffness and the\ncantilever one. The quality factor plays an important role. For large values of\nthe quality factor; it is predicted that a pure topography can be obtained\nwhatever the value of the contact stiffness. For a smaller quality factor, the\noscillator becomes more sensitive to change of the local mechanical properties.\nAs a direct consequence, varying the quality factor, for example with a vacuum\nchamber, would be a very interesting way to investigate soft materials either\nto access topographic information or nanomechanical properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2005 14:53:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}
