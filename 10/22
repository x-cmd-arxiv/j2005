The\nprobability that this pair is composed of unrelated M-type members of Upper\nScorpius is ~10^-5. When added to the recent discoveries of other wide, easily\ndisrupted low-mass binaries, this new system further establishes that the\nformation of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs does not require ejection from\nmultiple systems. These observations also indicate that wide low-mass binaries\ncan form in OB associations as well as in smaller clusters where the previously\nknown wide pairs have been found.

As the temperature is lowered below LNT, the\ndiffusion constant tends to a nearly temperature-independent value rather than\ncontinuing its activated trend. The low temperature branch is apparently\ncharacteristic of a quantum mechanical process dominated by tunneling in ground\nstate. Concommitantly, we apply an occurrence probability approach to\ndescribing the overall temperature dependence as a single continuous rate.\nWithin the adiabatic approximation the electronic eigenvalue depending\nparametrically on the nuclear coordinates is taken to be the potential energy\nto control the motion of the nuclei. The resulting rate involves all\nhorizontal-tunneling energy-conserving elastic transitions at the quantized\nenergy levels of the migrating atom.

Here we trap and manipulate individual\nhydrosomes. We demonstrate a controlled chemical reaction by the fusion of a\nhydrosome containing DNA segments approximately 1000 base pairs in length with\na hydrosome containing YOYO-1, a DNA intercalating dye. We furthermore detect\nthe fluorescence from single dye molecules in a hydrosome, and observe single\npair fluorescence resonance energy transfer (spFRET) from Cy3-Cy5 molecules\nattached to a single-stranded 16mer DNA molecule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2005 18:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The vacuum radiation field can be\nrepresented as such an oscillator bath, and so this model is in widespread use\nin quantum optics. Prior to the development of NMQSD, exact subsystem solutions\ncould only be obtained in a few special cases (e.g. spin-1/2, harmonic\noscillator). Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible to obtain exact\nsolutions to new problems using NMQSD due to the difficulty of solving the\nvariational-differential equations. Here we show that these equations can be\ntransformed into a pair of coupled nonlinear integrodifferential equations. We\ndevelop exact numerical methods for the integrodifferential equations and show\nthat solutions can be readily obtained to good accuracy for quite general\nsubsystems. We exactly solve various examples including tunneling in a double\nwell representing molecular isomerization or racemization, suppression of\nfluorescence from a two-level atom in a band gap, and intermittent fluorescence\nfrom a driven three level system representing electronic states of singly\nionized magnesium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2005 16:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
