The largest source of error in this correction to date has been the\ninterpolation of the PSF to the locations of the galaxies. To address this\nerror, we separate the PSF patterns into components that recur in multiple\nexposures/pointings and those that vary randomly between different exposures\n(such as those due to the atmosphere). In an earlier study we developed a\nprincipal component approach to correct the recurring PSF patterns (Jarvis and\nJain 2004). In this paper we show how randomly varying PSF patterns can also be\ncircumvented in the measurement of shear correlations. For the two-point\ncorrelation function this is done by simply using pairs of galaxy shapes\nmeasured in different exposures. Combining the two techniques allows us to\ntackle generic combinations of PSF anisotropy patterns. The second goal of this\npaper is to give a formalism for quantifying residual systematic errors due to\nPSF patterns. We show how the main PSF corrections improve with increasing\nsurvey area (and thus can stay below the reduced statistical errors), and we\nidentify the residual errors which do not scale with survey area. Our formalism\ncan be applied both to planned lensing surveys to optimize instrumental and\nsurvey parameters and to actual lensing data to quantify residual errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2005 18:01:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2005 21:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Even though the sample is restricted to the brightest portion of the\nBSS sequence, more than 300 candidates have been identified.

In\nsuch problems, network capacity enhancement is achieved as a tradeoff with\ntransmission delay. In this paper, the capacity of ad hoc networks supporting\ndelay sensitive traffic is studied. First, a general framework is proposed for\ncharacterizing the interactions between the physical and the network layer in\nan ad hoc network. Then, CDMA ad hoc networks, in which advanced signal\nprocessing techniques such as multiuser detection are relied upon to enhance\nthe user capacity, are analyzed. The network capacity is characterized using a\ncombination of geometric arguments and large scale analysis, for several\nnetwork scenarios employing matched filters, decorrelators and\nminimum-mean-square-error receivers. Insight into the network performance for\nfinite systems is also provided by means of simulations.
