We consider and adapt to our\naims two prescriptions for the size distribution of the dust grains and two\nmodels for the emission of the dusty ISM. We cross-check the emission and\nextinction models of the ISM by calculating the extinction curves and the\nemission for the typical environments of the Milky Way and the Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds and by comparing the results with the observational data. The\nfinal model we have adopted is an hybrid one which stems from combining the\nanalysis of Guhathakurta et al (1989) for the emission of graphite and\nsilicates and Puget et al.

On\nthe other hand, europium should be only an r-process element produced in the\nsame range of masses (10-30 solar masses), at variance with previous\nsuggestions indicating a smaller mass range for the Eu producers. As it is well\nknown, there is a large spread in the [Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] ratios at low\nmetallicities, although smaller in the newest data. With our model we estimate\nfor both elements (Ba and Eu) the ranges for the r-process yields from massive\nstars which better reproduce the trend of the data.

In this paper we argue\nthat such magnets possess field theoretic descriptions in terms of their slow\nfluctuating orders provided certain topological terms are included in the\naction. These topological terms may thus be viewed as what goes wrong within\nthe conventional LGW thinking. The field theoretic descriptions we develop are\npossible alternates to the popular gauge theories of such non-LGW behavior.\nExamples that are studied include weakly coupled quasi-one dimensional spin\nchains, deconfined critical points in fully two dimensional magnets, and two\ncomponent massless $QED_3$. A prominent role is played by an anisotropic O(4)\nnon-linear sigma model in three space-time dimensions with a topological theta\nterm. Some properties of this model are discussed. We suggest that similar\nsigma model descriptions might exist for fermionic algebraic spin liquid\nphases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2005 06:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Consequently, the\nintroduction of the zero-point electromagnetic fields in the vector potential\nA_x(t) used in the Schrodinger equation, generates ``double counting'', as was\nshown recently by A.J. Faria et al. (Physics Letters A 305 (2002) 322). We\nexplain, in details, how to avoid the ``double counting'' by introducing only\nthe radiation reaction and the thermal electromagnetic fields into the\nSchrodinger equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2005 23:08:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2006 22:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
