Of particular interest are galaxies at z~6\nsince they represent the earliest epoch accessible by current high-efficiency\noptical instrumentation. To this end, we have constructed a sample of 506 z~6\nobjects from all the deepest wide-area HST data (UDF, UDF-Parallel, and GOODS\nfields). They have been used to construct an optimal determination of the\nrest-frame continuum UV LF at z~6. Our LF extends to over 3 magnitudes below\nL*, fainter than has been done at z~3. Over the interval z~6 to z~3, we find\nstrong evidence for evolution in the UV LF. Though constraints on the faint-end\nslope remain modest (and are consistent with no-evolution), the characteristic\nluminosity appears to have approximately doubled over the interval z~6 to z~3,\nconsistent with hierarchical expectations. Remarkably, this shift to lower\nluminosities extends to even higher redshifts. Using all deep J+H NICMOS\nobservations (800 orbits in total), we have been able to demonstrate that the\nbright end of the LF (>0.3L*) is at least 5 times lower at z~10 than at z~4,\nwith a similar deficit being established from our recent detections and first\nstatistical sample of z~7-8 galaxies using our UDF NICMOS data.

In a specific frequency range, this noise may rise above the\ninstrumental noise sources and hence hinder detection of other types of\nsignals, e.g. extreme mass ratio inspirals of stellar mass objects into\nsupermassive black holes. In most previous studies only detached populations of\ncompact object binaries have been considered. Here, we investigate the\ninfluence of Galactic populations of compact mass transferring binaries on the\nshape and strength of the LISA signal and compare our results with the signal\nfor detached binaries only. Our population synthesis includes all binary\nsystems containing two compact remnants. It is found that 99.5% of these\nsystems are double white dwarfs, and therefore we consider only binaries\nconsisting of two white dwarfs when calculating the LISA signal. We find that\nthe mass transferring binaries contributing to the confusion limited noise\ndominate the population of LISA systems by number (60%), due to their long\nlifetimes (few Gyrs). However, due to the very specific physical properties of\nmass transferring systems, it is found that their contribution to the noise is\nnegligible at low frequencies and detached systems will set the magnitude of\nthe confusion-limited signal in this range. However, the mass transferring\nsystems begin to dominate the signal at higher frequencies (f>6 mHz). The\ntransition frequency at which the confusion limited regime becomes important is\nfound at 4 mHz.
