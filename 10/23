This claim was\nsurprising as it ran counter to the Newtonian expectation that a neutron star\nin a binary should be more stable, not less. After correcting an error found by\nFlanagan, Wilson and Mathews found that the compression of the neutron stars\nwas significantly reduced but not eliminated. This has motivated us to ask the\nfollowing general question: Under what circumstances can general-relativistic\ntidal interactions cause an otherwise stable neutron star to be compressed? We\nhave found that if a nonrotating neutron star possesses a current-quadrupole\nmoment, interactions with a gravitomagnetic tidal field can lead to a\ncompressive force on the star. If this current quadrupole is induced by the\ngravitomagnetic tidal field, it is related to the tidal field by an\nequation-of-state-dependent constant called the gravitomagnetic Love number.\nThis is analogous to the Newtonian Love number that relates the strength of a\nNewtonian tidal field to the induced mass quadrupole moment of a star. The\ncompressive force is almost never larger than the Newtonian tidal interaction\nthat stabilizes the neutron star against collapse. In the case in which a\ncurrent quadrupole is already present in the star (perhaps as an artifact of a\nnumerical simulation), the compressive force can exceed the stabilizing one,\nleading to a net increase in the central density of the star. This increase is\nsmall (<~1%) but could, in principle, cause gravitational collapse in a star\nthat is close to its maximum mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2005 12:31:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2005 05:13:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 May 2006 17:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We consider the most general\naction depending on the velocities and relative positions of the particles. The\nPoincare invariant parameters that label successive events along the world\nlines can be identified with the proper times of the particles provided that\ncertain conditions are impossed on the interaction terms in the action. Further\nconditions on the interaction terms arise from the requirement that mass be a\nscalar. A generic class of theories with interactions that satisfy these\nconditions is found. The relativistic equations of motion for these theories\nare presented. We obtain exact circular orbits solutions of the relativistic\none-body problem. The exact relativistic one-body Hamiltonian is also derived.\nThe theory has three components: a linearly rising potential, a Coulomb-like\ninteraction and a dynamical component to the Poincar\\'e invariant mass. At the\nquantum level we obtain the generalized Klein-Gordon-Fock equation and the\nDirac equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2005 23:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

A definition of\nvirtual displacement is presented that allows one to express them explicitly\nfor holonomic (velocity independent), non-holonomic (velocity dependent),\nscleronomous (time independent) and rheonomous (time dependent) constraints. It\nis observed that for holonomic, scleronomous constraints, the virtual\ndisplacements are the displacements allowed by the constraints. However, this\nis not so for a general class of constraints. For simple physical systems, it\nis shown that, the work done by the constraint forces on virtual displacements\nis zero. This motivates Lagrange's extension of d'Alembert's principle to\nsystem of particles in constrained motion. However a similar zero work\nprinciple does not hold for the allowed displacements. It is also demonstrated\nthat d'Alembert's principle of zero virtual work is necessary for the\nsolvability of a constrained mechanical problem. We identify this special class\nof constraints, physically realized and solvable, as {\\it the ideal\nconstraints}.
