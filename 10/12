The planet orbits its star in 15.56 days. The circular\nradial-velocity variation presents a tiny semi-amplitude of 4.1 m/s that\ncorresponds to a planetary minimum mass m2sin(i)=14.1 Earth masses. The planet\nwas unveiled by high-precision radial-velocity measurements obtained with the\nHARPS spectrograph on the ESO 3.6-m telescope. The radial-velocity residuals\naround the Keplerian solution are 1.3 m/s, demonstrating the very high quality\nof the HARPS measurements. Activity and bisector indicators exclude any\nsignificant perturbations of stellar intrinsic origin, which supports the\nplanetary interpretation. Contrary to most planet-host stars, HD4308 has a\nmarked sub-solar metallicity ([Fe/H]=-0.31), raising the possibility that very\nlight planet occurrence might show a different coupling with the parent star's\nmetallicity than do giant gaseous extra-solar planets. Together with\nNeptune-mass planets close to their parent stars, the new planet occupies a\nposition in the mass-separation parameter space that is constraining for\nplanet-formation and evolution theories. The question of whether they can be\nconsidered as residuals of evaporated gaseous giant planets, ice giants, or\nsuper-earth planets is discussed in the context of the latest core-accretion\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2005 14:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Our work is based on the assumption that the massive body is not\nnecessarily a Kerr black hole, and that the vacuum exterior spacetime is\nstationary axisymmetric,described by a metric which deviates slightly from the\nKerr metric. We first provide a simple recipe for building such a `quasi-Kerr'\nmetric by adding to the Kerr metric the deviation in the value of the\nquadrupole moment. We then study geodesic motion in this metric,focusing on\nequatorial orbits. We proceed by computing `kludge' waveforms which we compare\nwith their Kerr counterparts. We find that a modest deviation from the Kerr\nmetric is sufficient for producing a significant mismatch between the\nwaveforms, provided we fix the orbital parameters. This result suggests that an\nattempt to use Kerr waveform templates for studying EMRIs around a non-Kerr\nobject might result in serious loss of signal-to-noise ratio and total number\nof detected events. The waveform comparisons also unveil a `confusion' problem,\nthat is the possibility of matching a true non-Kerr waveform with a Kerr\ntemplate of different orbital parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2005 21:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Renormalization\neffects of intermediate scale MSSM-charged exotics (ISME) (endemic to\nquasi-realistic string models) can resolve this issue, pushing the MSSM scale\nup to the string scale. However, for a generic string model, this implies that\nthe projected Lambda_U unification under ISD is accidental. If the true\nunification scale is 5.0x10^(17) GeV, is it possible that illusionary\nunification at 2.5x10^(17) GeV in the ISD scenario is not accidental? If it is\nnot, then under what conditions would the assumption of ISME in a WCHS model\nimply apparent unification at Lambda_U when ISD is falsely assumed? Geidt's\n\"optical unification\" suggests that Lambda_U is not accidental, by offering a\nmechanism whereby a generic MSSM scale Lambda_U < Lambda_H is guaranteed. A\nWCHS model was constructed that offers the possibility of optical unification,\ndepending on the availability of anomaly-cancelling flat directions meeting\ncertain requirements.

Stringent flat directions can be guaranteed to be F-flat to all finite\norder (or to at least a given finite order consistent with electroweak scale\nsupersymmetry breaking) and can be viewed as the likely roots of more general\nflat directions.

If we assume that the proton was a spectator to the reaction\ntaking place on the neutron in deuterium, the initial state of that neutron can\nbe inferred. This method, known as spectator tagging, can be used to study\nelectron scattering from high-momentum (off-shell) neutrons in deuterium. The\ndata were taken with a 5.765 GeV electron beam on a deuterium target in\nJefferson Laboratory's Hall B, using the CLAS detector. A reduced cross section\nwas extracted for different values of final-state missing mass $W^{*}$,\nbackward proton momentum $\\vec{p}_{s}$ and momentum transfer $Q^{2}$. The data\nare compared to a simple PWIA spectator model. A strong enhancement in the data\nobserved at transverse kinematics is not reproduced by the PWIA model. This\nenhancement can likely be associated with the contribution of final state\ninteractions (FSI) that were not incorporated into the model. A ``bound neutron\nstructure function'' $F_{2n}^{eff}$ was extracted as a function of $W^{*}$ and\nthe scaling variable $x^{*}$ at extreme backward kinematics, where effects of\nFSI appear to be smaller. For $p_{s}>400$ MeV/c, where the neutron is far\noff-shell, the model overestimates the value of $F_{2n}^{eff}$ in the region of\n$x^{*}$ between 0.25 and 0.6. A modification of the bound neutron structure\nfunction is one of possible effects that can cause the observed deviation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2005 16:51:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2005 18:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

With singularities\nin the HantiH PEC as found by Aldrovandi and Puget and by Junker and Bardsley,\nany cusp in the HantiH PEC significantly affects the annihilation cross\nsection. This problem for the HantiH interaction generated many new wave\nmechanical calculations mainly to remove annoying cusps. We review all\navailable PECs for 4-unit charge systems and find that corrections for the\nMorgan-Hughes HantiH PEC can either go to the repulsive side (to the\nconventionally expected annihilation channel) or to the opposite attractive\nside (to the attractive branch of the observed PEC of natural molecular HH). We\nobserve that all theoretical HantiH PECs published thus far would intersect the\nobserved PEC of natural HH. This is, however, impossible with the non-crossing\nrule. A classical ab initio calculation of the electrostatic perturbation\nbrings the HantiH PEC much closer to the observed HH PEC than to the PEC of the\nannihilative channel. This new unprecedented result for long-range behavior in\n4-unit charge Coulomb systems confirms that natural antiH must exist and that\nmolecule HH must be interpreted as HantiH. In fact, this seems to be the only\nsolution left, if PECs for systems HH and HantiH with the same symmetry cannot\ncross.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2005 11:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
