A corollary is that, in cold\ndark matter cosmology, galactic halos have inner caustics in addition to the\nmore obvious outer caustics. The outer caustics are fold catastrophes located\non topological spheres surrounding the galaxy. To obtain the catastrophe\nstructure of the inner caustics, we simulate the infall of cold collisionless\nparticles in a fixed gravitational potential. The structure of inner caustics\ndepends on the angular momentum distribution of the infalling particles. We\nconfirm a previous result that the inner caustic is a \"tricusp ring\" when the\ninitial velocity field is dominated by net overall rotation. A tricusp ring is\na closed tube whose cross section is a section of an elliptic umbilic\ncatastrophe. However, tidal torque theory predicts that the initial velocity\nfield is irrotational. For irrotational initial velocity fields, we find the\ninner caustic to have a tent-like structure which we describe in detail in\nterms of the known catastrophes. We also show how the tent caustic transforms\ninto a tricusp ring when a rotational component is added to the initial\nvelocity field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2005 16:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The equivalent width of\nthe emission line is constrained in just twelve objects but with low (<2 sigma)\nsignificance in most cases. For the sources whose spectra are well-fit by the\nbroken power-law model, we find that various optical and X-ray line and\ncontinuum parameters are well-correlated; in particular, the power-law photon\nindex is well-correlated with the FWHM of the Hbeta line and the photon indices\nof the low and high energy components of the broken power-law are\nwell-correlated with each other.

In the univariate case,\nwe briefly illustrate this approach for certain sums of nonlinear functions of\nmultivariate normal variables. As a second illustration, we show that the\nmultivariate distribution counting the number of vertices with given degrees in\ncertain random graphs is asymptotically multivariate normal and obtain a bound\non the rate of convergence. Both examples demonstrate that this approach may be\nsuitable for situations involving non-local dependence. We also present Theorem\n1.4 for sums of vectors having a local type of dependence.

These effects can be compensated for by modeling the\ncorresponding spread of photons in 3D within the system matrix used for\ntomographic reconstruction. The fully 3D Monte Carlo (F3DMC) reconstruction\ntechnique consists in calculating this system matrix using Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The inverse problem of tomographic reconstruction is then solved\nusing conventional iterative algorithms such as maximum likelihood expectation\nmaximization (MLEM). Although F3DMC has already shown promising results, its\nuse is currently limited by two major issues: huge size of the fully 3D system\nmatrix and long computation time required for calculating a robust and accurate\nsystem matrix. To address these two issues, we propose to calculate the F3DMC\nsystem matrix using a spatial sampling matching the functional regions to be\nreconstructed. In this approach, different regions of interest can be\nreconstructed with different spatial sampling. For instance, a single value is\nreconstructed for a functional region assumed to contain uniform activity. To\nassess the value of this approach, Monte Carlo simulations have been performed\nusing GATE. Results suggest that F3DMC reconstruction using functional regions\nimproves quantitative accuracy compared to the F3DMC reconstruction method\nproposed so far. In addition, it considerably reduces disk space requirement\nand duration of the simulations needed to estimate the system matrix.

The asymptotic solutions of\nthe proper two-electron Schrodinger equation have been derived for both\nelectron-nucleus and electron-electron coalescence. It is shown that the\nsolutions for the electron-nucleus coalescence correspond to the ground and\nsingly excited bound states, including triplet ones. The proper solutions at\nsmall distances $R$ from the triple coalescence point were presented as the\nsecond order expansion on R and lnR. The vanishing of the Fock's logarithmic\nterms at the electron-nucleus coalescence line was revealed in the frame of\nthis expansion, unlike the case of electron-electron coalescence. On the basis\nof the obtained boundary solutions the approximate wave function corresponding\nto both coalescence lines have been proposed in the two-exponential form with\nno variational parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2005 09:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
