Although 8 sources have been\ndetected within a circular diameter of 25' centred on V1647 Ori, we did not\ndetect any radio continuum emission from McNeil's nebula.

Three scenarios namely, emission\nfrom homogeneous HII region, ionised stellar wind and shock ionised gas, are\nexplored in the light of our GMRT upper-limit. For the case of homogeneous HII\nregion, the radius of the emitting region is constrained to be <~ 26 AU\ncorresponding to a temperature >~ 2,500 K, which is consistent with the\nreported radio and H-alpha emission. In the ionised stellar wind picture, our\nupper limit of radio emission translates to the ratio of mass loss rate and\nterminal velocity, (M_dot/v_infinity) < 1.2-1.8 x 10^(-10) (M_sun/yr)/(km/s).\nOn the other hand, if the stellar wind shocks the dense neutral (molecular)\ncloud, the radio upper limit implies that the fraction of the wind encountering\nthe dense obstacle is <50%. Based on a recent measurement of X-ray outburst and\nlater monitoring, the expected radio emission has been estimated. Using our\nradio limit, the radius (<~ 36 AU) and electron density (>~ 7.2 x 10^7 cm^(-3)\nof the radio emitting plasma have been constrained using a two phase medium in\npressure equilibrium for a volume filling factor of 0.9.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2005 07:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Decades ago it was already known\nthat the moving contact line is incompatible with the no-slip boundary\ncondition, since the latter would imply infinite dissipation due to a\nnon-integrable singularity in the stress near the contact line. In this paper\nwe first present an introductory review of the problem. We then present a\ndetailed review of our recent results on the contact-line motion in immiscible\ntwo-phase flow, from MD simulations to continuum hydrodynamics calculations.\nThrough extensive MD studies and detailed analysis, we have uncovered the slip\nboundary condition governing the moving contact line, denoted the generalized\nNavier boundary condition. We have used this discovery to formulate a continuum\nhydrodynamic model whose predictions are in remarkable quantitative agreement\nwith the MD simulation results at the molecular level. These results serve to\naffirm the validity of the generalized Navier boundary condition, as well as to\nopen up the possibility of continuum hydrodynamic calculations of immiscible\nflows that are physically meaningful at the molecular level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2005 07:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show that, in the 5d description, the flux stabilization of this\nhierarchy (or, equivalently, of the brane-to-brane distance) can be understood\nas an implementation of the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. This mechanism relies on\nthe non-trivial bulk profile of the so-called Goldberger-Wise scalar, which in\naddition has fixed expectation values at the boundaries and thereby stabilizes\nthe size of the 5d interval. The Goldberger-Wise scalar is realized\nmicroscopically by the continuously varying flux of the Neveu-Schwarz 2-form\npotential B_2 on the S^2 cycle in the throat. Its back-reaction on the 5d\ngeometry leads to a significant departure from a pure AdS_5 background. We also\nfind that, for a wide range of parameters, the universal Kaehler modulus of the\n10d compactification plays the role of a UV-brane field in the equivalent 5d\nmodel. It governs the size of a large 4d curvature term localized at the UV\nbrane.

These include, among others,\ntranscription factor activation by phosphorylation and acetylation, formation\nof active complexes with one or more co-factors, and mRNA/protein degradation\nand stabilization processes.\n  This paper presents a first step towards the systematic, genome-wide\ncomputational inference of genes that modulate the interactions of specific\ntranscription factors at the post-transcriptional level. The method uses a\nstatistical test based on changes in the mutual information between a\ntranscription factor and each of its candidate targets, conditional on the\nexpression of a third gene. The approach was first validated on a synthetic\nnetwork model, and then tested in the context of a mammalian cellular system.\nBy analyzing 254 microarray expression profiles of normal and tumor related\nhuman B lymphocytes, we investigated the post transcriptional modulators of the\nMYC proto-oncogene, an important transcription factor involved in\ntumorigenesis. Our method discovered a set of 100 putative modulator genes,\nresponsible for modulating 205 regulatory relationships between MYC and its\ntargets. The set is significantly enriched in molecules with function\nconsistent with their activities as modulators of cellular interactions,\nrecapitulates established MYC regulation pathways, and provides a notable\nrepertoire of novel regulators of MYC function. The approach has broad\napplicability and can be used to discover modulators of any other transcription\nfactor, provided that adequate expression profile data are available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2005 04:26:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2006 06:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As it can be observed the customary\nthree generalization methods {\\it (symmetry, algebraic and dynamical)} have\nnever been considered in neither of them. Our intention in this work is at\nfirst to investigate the lost ring between the customary three methods and the\nrecently developed ones, as possible. For this purpose it has been devised\ngeneral analytic descriptions, which successfully demonstrate how different\nvarieties of CSs (which are nonlinear in nature) can be obtained by two\nprocesses, first the {\\it \"nonlinear CSs\"} method and second by {\\it \"basis\ntransformations on an underlying Hilbert spaces\"}. As a result, I will\nsystematize the recently introduced generalized CSs in a clear and concise way.\nIt will be clear also, that how our results can be considered as a first step\nin the generation process of the mathematical physics CSs in the context of\nquantum optics. Besides this, some new results emerge from our studies. I\nintroduce a large classes of generalized CSs, namely the {\\it \"dual family\"}\nassociated with each set of early known CSs. But, in this relation, the\nprevious processes for constructing the dual pair of Gazeau-Klauder CSs fail to\nwork well, so I outlined a rather different method based on the {\\it \"temporal\nstability\"} requirement of generalized nonlinear CSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2005 06:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
