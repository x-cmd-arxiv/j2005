The purpose of this paper is to reconsider the\nplausibility of line driving of W-R winds within the standard approach using\nthe Sobolev approximation while advancing the conceptual understanding of this\ntopic. Due to the multiple scattering required in this context, of particular\nimportance is the role of photon frequency redistribution into spectral gaps,\nwhich in the extreme limit yields the statistical Sobolev-Rosseland (SSR) mean\napproximation. Interesting limits to constrain are the extremes of no frequency\nredistribution, wherein the small radii and corresponding high W-R surface\ntemperature induces up to twice the mass-loss rate relative to cooler stars,\nand the SSR limit, whereby the reduced efficiency of the driving drops the mass\nflux by as much as an order of magnitude whenever there exist significant gaps\nin the spectral line distribution. To see how this efficiency drop might be\nsufficiently avoided to permit high W-R mass loss, we explore the suggestion\nthat ionization stratification may serve to fill the gaps globally over the\nwind. We find that global ionization changes can only fill the gaps\nsufficiently to cause about a 25% increase in the mass-loss rate over the local\nSSR limit.

The X-ray light curve is\ndominated by a short, bright phase interval with EPIC pn count rates reaching\nup to 15 cts/sec per 30 sec resolution bin. The bright phase emission is well\ndescribed by a single blackbody component with kT_bb = (45 +- 3) eV. The\nabsence of a bremsstrahlung component at photon energies above 1 keV yields a\nflux ratio F_bb/F_br > 6700. This represents the most extreme case of a soft\nX-ray excess yet observed in an AM Herculis star. The bright, soft X-ray\nemission is subdivided into a series of individual flare events supporting the\nhypothesis that the soft X-ray excess in V1309 is caused by accretion of dense\nblobs. In addition to the bright phase emission, a faint, hard X-ray component\nis visible throughout the binary orbit with an almost constant count rate of\n0.01 cts/sec.

At least three components of an optically\nthin plasma with temperatures kT= 0.065, 0.7, and 2.9 keV are required to fit\nthe observed flux distribution.

We also discuss the issue of the inclusion of distributed\nproperties in synthesis models; as a paradigm of this case, we illustrate the\ndifficulties implied by the inclusion of tracks with rotation in synthesis\nmodels. Finally, we describe several examples of the statistical approach to\npopulation synthesis. We report on the failure of the fuel consumption theorem\n(FCT) and the isochrone synthesis code to produce mutually consistent results.\nHowever, we argue that FCT and isochrone synthesis results are reliable for\napplication to real systems in the wavelength range where they coincide. On the\nconstructive side, we derive several useful survival strategies to bypass\nuncertainties. We show that single stellar populations at the turn-off ages of\nthe tabulated tracks can be safely compared, as they are scarcely affected by\nthe interpolation scheme used to compute isochrones. Finally, we suggest to use\nderivative quantities, such as the SN-rate, as bug detectors. On the\nrecommendation side, we advocate for greater transparency and more\ndocumentation in synthesis modeling.

In\ncontrast, competitive accretion theory suggests that at birth all stars are\nmuch smaller than the typical stellar mass (~0.5 solar masses), and that final\nstellar masses are determined by the subsequent accretion of unbound gas from\nthe clump. Competitive accretion models explain brown dwarfs and free-floating\nplanets as protostars ejected from star-forming clumps before accreting much\nmass, predicting that they should lack disks, have high velocity dispersions,\nand form more frequently in denser clumps. They also predict that mean stellar\nmass should vary within the Galaxy.

Caustics are places where the CDM\nparticles are naturally focussed. Our focus is upon the caustic rings which are\nclosed tubes whose cross-section is an elliptic umbilic catastrophe with three\ndual cusps. A caustic ring has a specific density profile, a specific geometry\nand, therefore, precisely calculable gravitational lensing signatures. The\nmagnification monotonically increases as the line of sight approaches to the\ncusps where it diverges in the limit of zero velocity dispersion. In this\nlimit, we find 37% magnification at a sample point near the outer cusps of the\nCDM caustic rings at cosmological distances. In the presence of finite velocity\ndispersion, the lower and upper bounds of the effective velocity dispersions of\nthe axion and WIMP flows in galactic halos may be used to constrain the lensing\neffects at the cusps. For a cosmological axion caustic ring, we find that the\nmagnification may range between 3% and 2800% at the outer cusp, and between 2%\nand 46% at the non-planer cusps.

The\nprojective hull is shown to have interesting properties and is related to\nvarious extremal functions and capacities in pluripotential theory. A main\nanalytic result asserts that for any point x in the projective hull K^ of a\ncompact set K in $P^n$, there exists a positive current T of bidimension (1,1)\nwith support in the closure of K^, and a probability measure $\\mu$ on K with $d\nd^cT=\\mu- [x]$. This result generalizes to any Kahler manifold and has strong\nconsequences for the structure of K^. We also introduce the notion of a\nprojective spectrum for Banach graded algebras, parallel to the Gelfand\nspectrum of a Banach algebra. This projective spectrum has universal properties\nexactly like those in the Gelfand case.

The corresponding surface lattices, that encode\nthe locations of the capsid proteins and intersubunit bonds, can be modelled by\nViral Tiling Theory.\n  It has been shown in vitro that under a variation of the experimental\nboundary conditions, such as the pH value and salt concentration, tubular\nparticles may appear instead of, or in addition to, spherical ones. In order to\ndevelop models that describe the simultaneous assembly of both spherical and\ntubular variants, and hence study the possibility of triggering tubular\nmalformations as a means of interference with the replication mechanism, Viral\nTiling Theory has to be extended to include tubular lattices with end caps.\nThis is done here for the case of Papovaviridae, which play a distinguished\nrole from the viral structural point of view as they correspond to all pentamer\nlattices, i.e. lattices formed from clusters of five protein subunits\nthroughout. These results pave the way for a generalisation of recently\ndeveloped assembly models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2005 14:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
