We use this\nrelation to estimate the effect of dust obscuration on the statistical\ndistributions of N(HI) and metallicity measured in magnitude-limited surveys of\nDLAs. In the redshift range where the measurements of zinc column densities\nhave sufficient statistics (1.8 </= z </= 3) we find that the obscuration bias\naffects the shapes of the observed distributions. The metallicity distribution\nis particularly affected by the bias, which hampers the detection of DLA\ngalaxies with near solar metallicity. Our results perfectly reproduce, without\ntuning the dust parameters, the DLA observational threshold log N(ZnII) </~\n13.15 found by Boisse' and collaborators in 1998, in terms of a rapid rise of\nthe obscuration. Our predictions of the effects of the bias on the statistics\nof DLAs are consistent with observational results obtained from unbiased\nsurveys of radio-selected quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2005 12:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The\nsample sizes are 50 nm, 75 nm, and 150 nm with a typical length of a few\nmicrons. The characterizations by XRD and TEM reveal that the samples consist\nof Ni nano-particles forming one dimensional (1D) chain-like structure. The\nmagnetic properties have been investigated by FC, ZFC measurements and M-H\nmeasurements. The results can be well explained within the context of\ncore-shell model. First of all, the freezing of disordered spins in the shell\nlayer have resulted in a peak-like structure on the ZFC curve. The peak\nposition occurs around TF ~ 13 K. With the 50 nm sample, the field dependent\nbehavior of TF(H) has been investigated in detail. It is well described by the\nde Almeida-Thouless (AT) equation for the surface spin glass state. Secondly,\nthe shape anisotropy of 1D structure has caused a wide separation between the\nFC and ZFC curves. This is mainly attributed to the blocking of the core\nmagnetism. Thirdly, by the M-H measurement in the low field region, the open\nhysteresis loop measured at 5 K < TF is significantly enlarged in comparison\nwith that taken at T > TF. This indicates that a significant part of the\ncontribution to the magnetic irreversibility at T < TF is coming from the\ndisordered spins in the shell layer. Lastly, with reducing sample size, the\ncoercivity, HC, increases, whereas the saturation magnetization goes down\ndramatically. These imply that, as the sample size reduces, the effect of shape\nanisotropy becomes larger in the magnetization reversal process and the\ncontribution to the magnetism from the ferromagnetically ordered core becomes\nsmaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2005 05:05:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2006 06:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This program has already been very successful with the\nrecent strong coupling constant determination at three-loops from 28\nobservables at three lattice spacings, and the one-loop light quark mass\ncalculation last year.

One motivation for considering this is to give insight into the fairly\ninscrutable Virtual Fibration Conjecture. For the special class of 3-manifolds\nwith tunnel number one, we provide compelling theoretical and experimental\nevidence that fibering is a very rare property. Indeed, in various precise\nsenses it happens with probability 0. Our main theorem is that this is true for\na measured lamination model of random tunnel number one 3-manifolds.\n  The first ingredient is an algorithm of K Brown which can decide if a given\ntunnel number one 3-manifold fibers over the circle. Following the lead of\nAgol, Hass and W Thurston, we implement Brown's algorithm very efficiently by\nworking in the context of train tracks/interval exchanges. To analyze the\nresulting algorithm, we generalize work of Kerckhoff to understand the dynamics\nof splitting sequences of complete genus 2 interval exchanges. Combining all of\nthis with a \"magic splitting sequence\" and work of Mirzakhani proves the main\ntheorem.\n  The 3-manifold situation contrasts markedly with random 2-generator 1-relator\ngroups; in particular, we show that such groups \"fiber\" with probability\nstrictly between 0 and 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2005 19:11:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2006 04:44:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Sep 2007 16:08:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2009 12:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-03"}

Mutual coupling becomes more pronounced as array aperture shrinks and\nis therefore a critical issue in compact array design. Two novel compact arrays\nare designed and fabricated for use in MIMO enabled mobile devices. These\narrays are extremely compact yet demonstrate acceptable mutual coupling and\nradiation efficiency because of the MIMO-specific criteria used during their\ndesign. An experimental methodology is presented for fair and meaningful\ncharacterization of MIMO arrays by field trial. This methodology addresses the\nissue of capacity normalization and quantifies how well an antenna array's\nradiation pattern interfaces with multipath propagation. Results are presented\nfrom an extensive measurement campaign in which a true MIMO transceiver testbed\nis outfitted with compact arrays and dipole arrays of various sizes.
