This provides a continuous description for this\nuniversality class, complementary to the different and already well documented\none for the case of an ``upper-wall''. The Langevin equation is written in\nterms of a field that is not an order-parameter, in contrast to standard\napproaches, and is studied both by employing a systematic mean-field\napproximation and by means of a recently introduced efficient integration\nscheme. Our findings are in good agreement with known results from microscopic\nmodels in this class, while the numerical precision is improved. This Langevin\nequation constitutes a sound starting point for further analytical\ncalculations, beyond mean-field, needed to shed more light on this poorly\nunderstood universality class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2005 10:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

To pin down the partonic EOS of matter produced at RHIC, the status of\nthermalization in such collisions has to be addressed. We propose to measure\ncollective flow of heavy-flavor quarks, e.g. charm quarks, as an indicator of\nthermalization of light flavors ($u,d,s$). The completion of the time of flight\nbarrel and the proposed upgrade with a $\\mu$Vertex detector for heavy-flavor\nidentification in STAR are well suited for achieving these goals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2005 20:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
