Since the Kretschmann invariant\ndiverges ($R_{iklm}R^{iklm} \\to \\infty$) at the singularity, one expects\nquantum effects to play an important role as the quiescent singularity is\napproached. We explore the effects of vacuum polarization due to massless\nconformally coupled fields near the singularity and show that these can either\ncause the universe to recollapse or, else, lead to a softer singularity at\nwhich $H$, ${\\dot H}$, and ${\\ddot H}$ remain finite while ${\\dddot H}$ and\nhigher derivatives of the Hubble parameter diverge. An important aspect of the\nquiescent singularity is that it is encountered in regions of low density,\nwhich has obvious implications for a universe consisting of a cosmic web of\nhigh and low density regions -- superclusters and voids. In addition to vacuum\npolarization, the effects of quantum particle production of non-conformal\nfields are also likely to be important. A preliminary examination shows that\nintense particle production can lead to an accelerating universe whose Hubble\nparameter shows oscillations about a constant value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2005 09:33:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2006 22:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

For pions, higher-twist subprocesses where\nthe pion is produced directly dominate at fixed target energy, while\nleading-twist partonic scattering plus fragmentation is the most important\nmechanism at collider energies. High-p_T baryons on the other hand appear to be\nproduced by higher-twist mechanisms at all available energies. The higher-twist\nmechanism of direct proton production can be verified experimentally by testing\nwhether high p_T protons are produced as single hadrons without accompanying\nsecondaries. In addition, we find that medium-induced gluon radiation in heavy\nion collisions can violate scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2005 11:14:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2005 13:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
