Firstly, the universe is\nrational and the rationality is the proportional density distribution in any\nindependent galaxy. Proportion means that the density distribution of stars is\norderly. For example, there are four giants standing in array. Their heights\nare A, B, C, D, respectively, and A, B stand in the first row from left to\nright, C, D in the second row from left to right. Proportion requires that A\ndivided by C be equal to B divided by D. Rational structures are smooth 2- (or\n3-) dimensional structures, which are either circularly (spherically) symmetric\nwith respect to the center point, or bilaterally symmetric. Secondly, spiral\ngalaxy arms are linearly shaped, which are neither circularly symmetric nor\nbilaterally symmetric. Therefore, arms are not rational structures. Arm\npatterns exist only in spiral galaxies and they are weak compared with the main\ndisk structure. Therefore, the presence of arm structure is the disturbance to\nthe rational structure. Because arm patterns exist only in spiral galaxies and\nonly spiral galaxies present dust, I come to the critical answer to the above\nquestion: any disturbance to rational structure produces cosmic dust. From now\non we call the disturbance to rational structure the cosmic impulse. Therefore,\nthe universe is originated not only rationally but also impulsively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2005 19:56:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2005 20:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2006 15:59:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 May 2008 20:07:43 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2008 04:34:37 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2010 15:43:04 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2010 02:16:33 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 16:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

This binary pulsar J0737-3039 has several\nremarkable features including among others: a very tight orbit with a Keplerian\nvelocity of ~600km/sec, a low eccentricity, and a location ~50pc from the\nGalactic plane implying that the system has, at high likelihood, a small\n(compared to Keplerian) center of mass velocity. A significant mass loss during\nthe formation of the second pulsar would have lead either to an eccentric orbit\nor to a large center of mass velocity or to both.

The first\nmethod, speckle field nulling, is a fast FFT-based algorithm that requires the\ndeformable-mirror influence functions to have identical shapes. The second\nmethod, speckle energy minimization, is more general and provides the optimal\ndeformable mirror shape via matrix inversion. With a NxN deformable mirror, the\nsize of matrix to be inverted is either N^2xN^2 in the general case, or only\nNxN if influence functions can be written as the tensor product of two\none-dimensional functions. Moreover, speckle energy minimization makes it\npossible to trade off some of the dark hole area against an improved contrast.\nFor both methods, complex wavefront aberrations (amplitude and phase) are\nmeasured using just three images taken with the science camera (no dedicated\nwavefront sensing channel is used), therefore there are no non-common path\nerrors.

The wide shear regions in these systems should be amenable\nto a continuum description, and the theoretical challenge lies in finding\nconstitutive relations between the internal stresses and the flow field. We\npropose a set of testable constitutive assumptions, including\nrate-independence, and investigate the additional restrictions on the\nconstitutive relations imposed by the flow geometries. The wide shear layers in\nthe highly symmetric linear shear and inclined plane flows are consistent with\nthe simple constitutive assumption that, in analogy with solid friction, the\neffective-friction coefficient (ratio between shear and normal stresses) is a\nconstant. However, this standard picture of granular flows is shown to be\ninconsistent with flows in the less symmetric split-bottom geometry - here the\neffective friction coefficient must vary throughout the shear zone, or else the\nshear zone localizes.

We consider neutralino annihilation via\nsquark exchange and parameterize the effective annihilation vertex as a\ndimension-six operator suppressed by two powers of the squark mass and related\nto the divergence of the axial vector current of the final-state quarks. Since\nthe axial vector current is conserved at tree level in the limit of massless\nquarks, this dimension-six operator contains a suppression by the quark mass.\nThe quark mass suppression can be lifted in two ways: (1) by corrections to the\ndimension-six operator involving the anomalous triangle diagram, and (2) by\ngoing to dimension-eight. We address the first of these possibilities by\nevaluating the anomalous triangle diagram, which contributes to neutralino\nannihilation to gluon pairs. We relate the triangle diagram via the anomaly\nequation to the decay of a pseudoscalar into two gluons and use the\nAdler-Bardeen theorem to extract the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD\ncorrections to chi chi --> gg from the known corrections to pseudoscalar decay.\nThe strong dependence of the dominant chi chi --> q qbar cross section on the\nrelative velocity of the neutralinos makes these NLO corrections unimportant at\nchi decoupling but significant today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2005 20:02:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2005 18:28:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2005 20:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-01"}

A PI forecast map originally published on 19\nFebruary 2002 for southern California successfully forecast the locations of\nsixteen of eighteen M>5 earthquakes during the past three years. The method has\nalso been successfully applied to Japan and on a worldwide basis. An\nalternative approach to earthquake forecasting is the relative intensity (RI)\nmethod. The RI forecast map is based on recent levels of seismic activity of\nsmall earthquakes. Recent advances in the PI method show considerable\nimprovement, particularly when compared with the RI method using relative\noperating characteristic (ROC) diagrams for binary forecasts. The RELM\napplication requires a probability for each location for a number of magnitude\nbins over a five year period. We have therefore constructed a hybrid forecast\nin which we combine the PI method with the RI method to compute a map of\nprobabilities for events occurring at any location, rather than just the most\nprobable locations.

Since such a transformation is not\nisometric, it cannot be achieved by any physical machine for a quantum state\ndrawn from a non orthogonal set: this is essentially the content of the\n\"no-cloning\" theorem.
