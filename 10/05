The MIR spectra of the low-metallicity\nstarburst sources are dominated by the [NeIII] and [SIV] lines, as well as a\nsteeply rising dust continuum. PAH bands are generaly faint, both locally and\naveraged over the full galaxy, in stark contrast to dustier starburst galaxies,\nwhere the PAH features are very prominant and even dominate on global scales.\nThe hardness of the modeled interstellar radiation fields for the dwarf\ngalaxies increases as the presence of PAH band emission becomes less\npronounced. The [NeIII]/[NeII] ratios averaged over the full galaxy are\nstrikingly high, often >10. Thus, the hard radiation fields are pronounced and\npervasive. We find a prominent correlation between the PAHs/VSGs and the\n[NeIII]/[NeII] ratios for a wide range of objects, including the low\nmetallicity galaxies as well as Galactic HII regions and other metal-rich\ngalaxies. This effect is consistent with the hardness of the interstellar\nradiation field playing a major role in the destruction of PAHs in the low\nmetallicity ISM.

The more interesting studied regime is\nthe one for large currents where there is sequence of transitions for the\ntransverse response of a fast moving VL. A transverse depinning temperature\nbelow the melting transition of the moving VL is obtained.\n  We also discuss the dependence with the direction of the applied dc current\nof the transport properties of diluted VL at low temperatures.

Both the mean interaction strength and the network\nconnectance increase relative to the null system as mutualism becomes more\nextensive. From a study of the dependence of average degree on the resource\nlevel we extract the diversity-connectance relationship which conforms to the\nhyperbolic form seen in field data.

The network\ndegree distributions conform more strongly to exponential than to the null\nbinomial distributions in all cases.
