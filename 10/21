The DM halo models are\nconstructed with various asymptotic power-law indices ranging from steep cusps\nto core-like profiles and the structural properties of the galaxy models are\nmotivated by the LCDM paradigm of structure formation. The adopted force\nresolution allows robust density profile estimates in the inner ~1% of the\nvirial radii of the simulated systems. We demonstrate that the central slopes\nand overall shapes of the remnant density profiles are virtually identical to\nthose of the initial systems suggesting that the remnants retain a remarkable\nmemory of the density structure of their progenitors, despite the relaxation\nthat accompanies merger activity. We also find that halo concentrations remain\napproximately constant through hierarchical merging involving identical systems\nand show that remnants contain significant fractions of their bound mass well\nbeyond their formal virial radii. These conclusions hold for a wide variety of\ninitial asymptotic density slopes, orbital energies, and encounter\nconfigurations, including sequences of consecutive merger events, simultaneous\nmergers of severals ystems, and mergers of halos with embedded cold baryonic\ncomponents in the form of disks, spheroids, or both.

The derived 1D, non-LTE 7Li abundances from the LiI 670.8nm line\nreveal a pronounced dependence on metallicity but with negligible scatter\naround this trend. Very good agreement is found between the abundances from the\nLiI 670.8nm line and the LiI 610.4nm line. The estimated primordial 7Li\nabundance is $7Li/H = 1.1-1.5 x 10^-10, which is a factor of three to four\nlower than predicted from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis with the baryon\ndensity inferred from the cosmic microwave background. Interestingly, 6Li is\ndetected in nine of our 24 stars at the >2sigma significance level. Our\nobservations suggest the existence of a 6Li plateau at the level of log 6Li =\n0.8; however, taking into account predictions for 6Li destruction during the\npre-main sequence evolution tilts the plateau such that the 6Li abundances\napparently increase with metallicity. Our most noteworthy result is the\ndetection of 6Li in the very metal-poor star LP815-43. Such a high 6Li\nabundance during these early Galactic epochs is very difficult to achieve by\nGalactic cosmic ray spallation and alpha-fusion reactions. It is concluded that\nboth Li isotopes have a pre-Galactic origin. Possible 6Li production channels\ninclude proto-galactic shocks and late-decaying or annihilating supersymmetric\nparticles during the era of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The presence of 6Li\nlimits the possible degree of stellar 7Li depletion and thus sharpens the\ndiscrepancy with standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2005 12:50:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2006 00:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The basic challenge addressed\nin our work is to calculate the decoherence of electrons interacting with a\nquantum-mechanical environment, while taking proper account of the Pauli\nprinciple. First, we review the usual influence functional approach valid for\ndecoherence of electrons due to classical noise, showing along the way how the\nquantitative accuracy can be improved by properly averaging over closed (rather\nthan unrestricted) random walks. We then use a heuristic approach to show how\nthe Pauli principle may be incorporated into a path-integral description of\ndecoherence in weak localization. This is accomplished by introducing an\neffective modification of the quantum noise spectrum, after which the\ncalculation proceeds in analogy to the case of classical noise. Using this\nsimple but efficient method, which is consistent with much more laborious\ndiagrammatic calculations, we demonstrate how the Pauli principle serves to\nsuppress the decohering effects of quantum fluctuations of the environment, and\nessentially confirm the classic result of Altshuler, Aronov and Khmelnitskii\nfor the energy-averaged decoherence rate, which vanishes at zero temperature.\nGoing beyond that, we employ our method to calculate explicitly the leading\nquantum corrections to the classical decoherence rates, and to provide a\ndetailed analysis of the energy-dependence of the decoherence rate. The basic\nidea of our approach is general enough to be applicable to decoherence of\ndegenerate Fermi systems in contexts other than weak localization as well. --\nPaper II will provide a more rigorous diagrammatic basis for our results, by\nrederiving them from a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the Cooperon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2005 07:23:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-02"}

Radiative corrections to the quadratic part of the\nscalar potential are constrained to be symmetric under a global U(4) x U(4)'\nsymmetry due to a discrete Z_2 \"twin\" parity, while the quartic part does not\npossess this symmetry. As a consequence, when the global symmetry is broken the\nHiggs fields emerge as light pseudo-Goldstone bosons, but with sizable quartic\nself-interactions. This structure allows the cutoff scale, \\Lambda, to be\nraised to the multi-TeV region without significant fine-tuning. In the minimal\nversion of the theory, the amount of fine-tuning is about 15% for \\Lambda = 5\nTeV, while it is about 30% in an extended model. This provides a solution to\nthe little hierarchy problem. In the minimal model, the \"visible\" particle\ncontent is exactly that of the two Higgs doublet standard model, while the\nextended model also contains extra vector-like fermions with masses ~(1-2)TeV.\nAt the LHC, our minimal model may appear exactly as the two Higgs doublet\nstandard model, and new physics responsible for cutting off the divergences of\nthe Higgs mass-squared parameter may not be discovered.

We show for various models (spin damped by harmonic-oscillator or\nrandom-matrix baths, quantum diffusion, quantum Brownian motion) that upon\nincreasing the coupling up to a critical value still small enough to allow for\nweak-coupling Markovian master equations, a new relaxation regime can occur. In\nthat regime, complex frequencies lose their real parts such that the process\nbecomes overdamped. Our results call into question the standard belief that\noverdamping is exclusively a strong coupling feature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2005 18:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
