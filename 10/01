BHMFs at intermediate redshifts are calculated in two\nways. One way is from early-type galaxy luminosity functions (LFs); we assume\nan M_BH - L_sph correlation at a redshift by considering a passive evolution of\nL_sph in the local relationship. The resultant BHMFs (spheroid-BHMFs) from LFs\nof red sequence galaxies indicates a slight decrease of number density with\nincreasing redshift at M_BH > 10^{7.5-8} M_solar. Since a redshift evolution in\nslope and zeropoint of the M_BH - L_sph relation is unlikely to be capable of\nmaking such an evolution in BHMF, the evolution of the spheroid-BHMFs is\nperhaps due mainly to the decreasing normalization in the galaxy LFs. We also\ninvestigate how spheroid-BHMFs are affected by uncertainties existing in the\nderivation in detail. The other way of deriving a BHMF is based on the\ncontinuity equation for number density of SMBHs and LFs of active galactic\nnucleus (AGN). The resultant BHMFs (AGN-BHMFs) show no clear evolution out to z\n= 1 at M_BH > 10^8 M_solar, but exhibit a significant decrease with redshift in\nthe lower mass range. Comparison of the spheroid-BHMFs with the AGN-BHMFs\nsuggests that at M_BH > 10^{8} M_solar, the spheroid-BHMFs are broadly\nconsistent with the AGN-BHMFs out to z ~ 1. The agreement between the\nspheroid-BHMFs and the AGN-BHMFs appears to support that most of the SMBHs are\nalready hosted by massive spheroids at z ~ 1 and they evolve without\nsignificant mass growth since then.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2005 16:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

We consider systems\nevolving on general manifolds. The class of nonholonomic systems we study in\nthis paper includes, in particular, wheeled-type vehicles, which are important\nfor many robotic locomotion systems. The two special aspects of this optimal\ncontrol problem are the nonholonomic constraints and under-actuation.\nNonholonomic constraints restrict the evolution of the system to a distribution\non the manifold. The nonholonomic connection is used to express the constrained\nequations of motion. Furthermore, it is used to take variations of the cost\nfunctional. Many robotic systems are under-actuated since control inputs are\nusually applied through the robot's internal configuration space only. While we\ndo not consider symmetries with respect to group actions in this paper, the\nfact that the system is under-actuated is taken into account in our problem\nformulation. This allows one to compute reaction forces due to any inputs\napplied in directions orthogonal to the constraint distribution.

In our model problem, an interface between\ntwo immiscible layers of equal viscosity is deformed by an axisymmetric\nwithdrawal flow, which is driven by a point sink located some distance above\nthe interface in the upper layer. We find that steady-state hump solutions,\ncorresponding to selective withdrawal of liquid from the upper layer, cease to\nexist above a threshold withdrawal flux, and that this transition corresponds\nto a saddle-node bifurcation for the hump solutions. Numerical results on the\nshape evolution of the steady-state interface are compared against previous\nexperimental measurements. We find good agreement where the data overlap.\nHowever, the numerical results' larger dynamic range allows us to show that the\nlarge increase in the curvature of the hump tip near transition is not\nconsistent with an approach towards a power-law cusp shape, an interpretation\npreviously suggested from inspection of the experimental measurements alone.\nInstead the large increase in the curvature at the hump tip reflects a\nlogarithmic coupling between the overall height of the hump and the curvature\nat the tip of the hump.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2005 05:10:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2005 03:43:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2005 02:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2007 20:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is well known that the contact network, described in this\nsetting by a single parameter, the small-world parameter $p$, plays an\nimportant role both in the short term and in the long term dynamics of epidemic\nspread. We have studied the effect of the network structure on models of immune\nfor life diseases and found that in addition to the reduction of the effective\ntransmission rate, through the screening of infectives, spatial correlations\nmay strongly enhance the stochastic fluctuations. As a consequence, time series\nof unforced Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) models provide\npatterns of recurrent epidemics with realistic amplitudes, suggesting that\nthese models together with complex networks of contacts are the key ingredients\nto describe the prevaccination dynamical patterns of diseases such as measles\nand pertussis.

In response to signals\nsuch as DNA damage, p53 controls the transcription of a series of genes that\ncause cell cycle arrest during which DNA damage is repaired, or triggers\nprogrammed cell death that eliminates possibly cancerous cells wherein DNA\ndamage might have remained unrepaired. Previous experiments showed oscillations\nin p53 level in response to DNA damage, but the mechanism of oscillation\nremained unclear. Here we examine a model where the concentrations of p53\nisoforms are regulated by Mdm22, Arf, Siah, and beta-catenin. The extent of DNA\ndamage is signalled through the switch-like activity of a DNA damage sensor,\nthe DNA-dependent protein kinase Atm. This switch is responsible for initiating\nand terminating oscillations in p53 concentration. The strength of the DNA\ndamage signal modulates the number of oscillatory waves of p53 and Mdm22 but\nnot the frequency or amplitude of oscillations{a result that recapitulates\nexperimental findings. A critical fnding was that the phosphorylated form of\nNbs11, a member of the DNA break repair complex Mre11-Rad50-Nbs11 (MRN), must\naugment the activity of Atm kinase. While there is in vitro support for this\nassumption, this activity appears essential for p53 dynamics. The model\nprovides several predictions concerning, among others, degradation of the\nphosphorylated form of p53, the rate of DNA repair as a function of DNA damage,\nthe sensitivity of p53 oscillation to transcription rates of SIAH, beta-CATENIN\nand ARF, and the hysteretic behavior of active Atm kinase levels with respect\nto the DNA damage signal\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2005 00:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
