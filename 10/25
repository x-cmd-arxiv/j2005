Here we extend the model by\npresenting full 3-dimensional simulations of the evolution of the inclined\nexterior magnetic field immediately following vortex formation. The simulations\ncapture the violent reconnection events in the entangled surface magnetic field\nas it evolves into a smooth, more stable, configuration which consists of a\ndipole field aligned with the star's rotation axis. The total magnetic energy\ndissipated in this process is found to be of the order of $10^{44}\n\\mathrm{erg}$ and, if it is emitted as synchrotron radiation, peaks typically\nat $280 \\mathrm{keV}$. The intensity decays temporally in a way resembling SGRs\nand AXPs (anomalous X-ray pulsars), with a tail lasting from a few to a few\nhundred times the rotation period of the star, depending on the initial\ninclination between the rotation and dipole axis. One of the obvious\nconsequences of our model's final state (aligned rotator) is the suppression of\nradio-emission in SGRs and AXPs following their bursting era. We suggest that\nmagnetar-like magnetic field strength alone cannot be responsible for the\nproperties of SGRs and AXPs, while a quark star entering the ``Meissner phase''\nis compatible with the observational facts.

At smaller energies the continuum displays an excess with\nrespect to the extrapolation of this power law, called the ``soft X-ray\nexcess\". Until now it was attributed, either to reflection of the hard X-ray\nsource by the accretion disk, or to the presence of an additional comptonizing\nmedium. An alternative solution proposed by Gierli\\'nski & Done (2004) is that\na single power law represents correctly both the soft and the hard X-ray\nemission, and the soft X-ray excess is an artefact due to the absorption of the\nprimary power law by a relativistic wind.

We argue that in the\nabsorption hypothesis, the absorbing medium should be in total pressure\nequilibrium, to constrain the spectral distribution which otherwise would be\ntoo strongly variable in time and from one object to the other, as compared to\nobservations. We conclude that some X-ray spectra, in particular those with\nstrong soft X-ray excesses, can be modelled by absorption in the 0.3-10 keV\nrange. However, due to the lack of a complete grid of models and good data\nextending above 10 keV, we are not able to conclude presently that all objects\ncan be accommodated with such models. These absorption models imply either\nstrong relativistic outflowing winds with mass rates of the order of the\nEddington value (or even larger), or quasi-spherical inhomogeneous accretion\nflows.

Presently in use or under development are capabilities for Newtonian\nself-gravity, Newtonian and special relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (with\n`realistic' equation of state), and special relativistic energy- and\nangle-dependent neutrino transport--including full treatment of the energy and\nangle dependence of scattering and pair interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2005 03:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

By comparing\nH_2O- and H_2-sensitive spectral ratios between empirical data and theoretical\natmosphere models, and calibrating these ratios to measurements for the\nwell-characterized 2-5 Gyr companion brown dwarf Gliese 570D, we derive\nestimates of the effective temperatures and surface gravities for 13 mid- and\nlate-type field T dwarfs. We also deduce the first quantitative estimate of\nsubsolar metallicity for the peculiar T dwarf 2MASS 0937+2931. Derived\ntemperatures are consistent with prior estimates based on parallax and\nbolometric luminosity measurements, and examination of possible systematic\neffects indicate that the results are robust. Two recently discovered late-type\nT dwarfs, 2MASS 0939-2448 and 2MASS 1114-2618, both appear to be >50 K cooler\nthan the latest-type T dwarf, 2MASS 0415-0935, and are potentially the coldest\nand least luminous brown dwarfs currently known. We find that, in general,\nhigher surface gravity T dwarfs have lower effective temperatures and\nluminosities for a given spectral type, explaining previously observed scatter\nin the Teff/spectral type relation for these objects. Masses, radii and ages\nare estimated for the T dwarfs in our sample using the evolutionary models of\nBurrows et al.; we also determine masses and radii independently for eight T\ndwarfs with measured luminosities. These two determinations are largely\nconsistent, lending support to the validity of evolutionary models at late\nages. Our method is well suited to large samples of faint brown dwarfs, and can\nultimately be used to directly measure the substellar mass function and\nformation history in the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2005 03:44:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Previous field theoretical treatment\nviolated this symmetry, whereas others pointed out that constructing symmetry\npreserving perturbation theories is a crucial and open issue. In this work we\nsolve this problem and then apply our results to the mode-coupling theory of\nthe glass transition (MCT). We show that in the context of dynamical field\ntheories for glass-forming liquids TRS is expressed as a nonlinear field\ntransformation that leaves the action invariant. Because of this nonlinearity,\nstandard perturbation theories generically do not preserve TRS and in\nparticular FDRs. We show how one can cure this problem and set up\nsymmetry-preserving perturbation theories by introducing some auxiliary fields.\nAs an outcome we obtain Schwinger-Dyson dynamical equations that automatically\npreserve FDRs and that serve as a basis for carrying out symmetry-preserving\napproximations. We apply our results to MCT, revisiting previous field theory\nderivations of MCT equations and showing that they generically violate FDR. We\nobtain symmetry-preserving mode-coupling equations and discuss their advantages\nand drawbacks.

One of the most intriguing\nfeatures of such a model is that it also predicts small effects on the orbital\nmotion of test particles which could be tested in such a way that local\nmeasurements at Solar System scales would allow to get information on the\nglobal properties of the Universe. Lue and Starkman derived a secular\nextra-perihelion \\omega precession of 5\\times 10^-4 arcseconds per century,\nwhile Iorio showed that the mean longitude \\lambda is affected by a secular\nprecession of about 10^-3 arcseconds per century.

Up to now, the observational efforts\nfocused on the dynamics of the inner planets of the Solar System whose orbits\nare the best known via radar ranging. Since the competing Newtonian and\nEinsteinian effects like the precessions due to the solar quadrupole mass\nmoment J2, the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic part of the equations of\nmotion reduce with increasing distances, it would be possible to argue that an\nanalysis of the orbital dynamics of the outer planets of the Solar System, with\nparticular emphasis on Saturn because of the ongoing Cassini mission with its\nprecision ranging instrumentation, could be helpful in evidencing the predicted\nnew features of motion.

We have identified a wealth of\nnew different scaling regimes. We also found the maximal possible acceleration\nof the reaction due to sliding, we found that the maximum on the\nrate-versus-ionic strength curve is asymmetric, and that sliding can lead not\nonly to acceleration, but in some regimes to dramatic deceleration of the\nreaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2005 19:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The approach is based on the formal\nanalogy between thermal and quantum diffusion: by writing the solution of the\nFokker-Planck equation for the time-evolution of a protein in a viscous\nheat-bath in terms of a path integral, we derive a Hamilton-Jacobi variational\nprinciple from which we are able to compute the most probable pathway of\nfolding. The method is applied to the folding of the Villin Headpiece\nSubdomain, in the framework of a Go-model. We have found that, in this model,\nthe transition occurs through an initial collapsing phase driven by the\nstarting coil configuration and a later rearrangement phase, in which secondary\nstructures are formed and all computed paths display strong similarities. This\nmethod is completely general, does not require the prior knowledge of any\nreaction coordinate and represents an efficient tool to perfom ab-initio\nsimulations of the entire folding process with available computers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2005 17:03:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2005 10:32:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2006 14:11:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
