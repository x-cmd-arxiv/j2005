The use of\nGauss-Mainard-Codazzi equations allows us to investigate in detail the\ninfluence of curvature and torsion of vortex filaments in the MHD dynamos. This\napplication follows closely previous applications to Heisenberg spin equation\nto the investigations in magnetohydrostatics given by Schief (Plasma Physics J.\n10, 7, 2677 (2003)). The Lorentz force on vortex filaments are computed and the\nratio between the forces along different directions are obtained in terms of\nthe ratio between the corresponding magnetic fields which equals also the ratio\nbetween the Frenet torsion and vortex line curvature. A similar relation\nbetween Lorentz forces, magnetic fields and twist, which is proportional to\ntotal torsion integral has been obtained by Ricca (Fluid Dyn. Res. 36,319\n(2005)) in the case of inflexional desiquilibrium of magnetic flux-tubes. This\nis due to the fact that the magnetic vortex lines are a limit case of the\nmagnetic flux-tubes when the lenght of the tube is much greater than the radius\nof the tube. Magnetic helicity equation of the filament allows us again to\ndetermine the magnetic fields ratio from Frenet curvature and torsion of the\nvortex lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2005 19:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Lately, these layers have been\nspatially resolved by near and mid-IR interferometry. In this paper, we try to\nreconcile the IR interferometric and ISO-SWS spectroscopic results on Alpha\nOrionis with a thorough modelling of the photosphere, molecular layer(s) and\ndust shell.

We show how the radial breathing modes observed in a single Raman\nspectrum can be easily assigned based on these systematics. In addition,\nempirical fits provide the energies and radial breathing modes for all metallic\nand semiconducting nanotubes with diameters between 0.6 and 1.5 nm. We discuss\nthe relation between the frequency of the radial breathing mode and tube\ndiameter.

Although the rotational `intrinsic' gravimagnetic\nfield has been extensively studied and is now being measured by the Gravity\nProbe B, the `extrinsic' gravimagnetic field generated by the translational\ncurrent of matter is less well studied. The present paper uses the\npost-Newtonian parametrized Einstein and light geodesics equations to show that\nthe `extrinsic' gravimagnetic field generated by the translational current of\nmatter can be measured by observing the relativistic time delay and/or light\ndeflection caused by the moving mass. We prove that the `extrinsic'\ngravimagnetic field is generated by the relativistic effect of the aberration\nof the gravity force caused by the Lorentz transformation of the metric tensor\nand the Levi-Civita connection. We show that the Lorentz transformation of the\ngravity field variables is equivalent to the technique of the retarded\nLienard-Wiechert gravitational potentials predicting that a light particle is\ndeflected by gravitational field of a moving body from its retarded position so\nthat both general-relativistic phenomena -- the aberration and the retardation\nof gravity -- are tightly connected and observing the aberration of gravity\nproves that gravity has a causal nature. We explain in this framework the 2002\ndeflection experiment of a quasar by Jupiter where the aberration of gravity\nfrom its orbital motion was measured with accuracy 20%. We describe a theory of\nVLBI experiment to measure the gravitational deflection of radio waves from a\nquasar by the Sun, as viewed by a moving observer from the geocentric frame, to\nimprove the measurement accuracy of the aberration of gravity to a few percent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2005 20:54:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2006 15:47:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2007 20:33:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 29 May 2007 22:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

These\nsecond order corrections enter in the form of a {\\it cumulative} contribution\nfrom {\\it all} of their Fourier modes. In order to quantify their physical\nsignificance we study their effective equation of state by looking at the\nperturbed energy density and isotropic pressure to second order. We define the\nenergy density (isotropic pressure) in terms of the (averaged) eigenvalues\nassociated with timelike (spacelike) eigenvectors of a total stress energy for\nthe metric and matter fluctuations. Our work suggests that that for many\nparameters of slow-roll inflation, the second order contributions to these\nenergy density and pressures may dominate over the first order effects for the\ncase of super-Hubble evolution. These results hold in our choice of first and\nsecond order coordinate conditions however we also argue that other\n`reasonable` coordinate conditions do not alter the relative importance of the\nsecond order terms.

As the voltage decays, only ions of higher and higher\nmobility are collected by the central electrode and contribute to the further\ndecay of the voltage. This enables extension of the classical theory to\ncalculate ion mobility spectra by inverting voltage decay time series. In\nindoor air, ion mobility spectra determined from both the novel voltage decay\ninversion, and an established voltage switching technique, were compared and\nshown to be of similar shape. Air conductivities calculated by integration\nwere: 5.3 +- 2.5 fS/m and 2.7 +- 1.1 fS/m respectively, with conductivity\ndetermined to be 3 fS/m by direct measurement at a constant voltage.\nApplications of the new Relaxation Potential Inversion Method (RPIM) include\nair ion mobility spectrum retrieval from historical data, and computation of\nion mobility spectra in planetary atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2005 10:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This problem\nis relevant to ocean waves propagation on shallow continental shelves where\ntidal currents are often significant. A perturbation expansion of the wave\naction to second order in powers of the bottom amplitude yields an evolution\nequation for the wave action spectrum. A scattering source term gives the rate\nof exchange of the wave action spectrum between wave components, with\nconservation of the total action at each absolute frequency. With and without\ncurrent, the scattering term yields reflection coefficients for the amplitudes\nof waves that converge, to the results of previous theories for monochromatic\nwaves propagating in one dimension over sinusoidal bars. Over sandy continental\nshelves, tidal currents are known to generate sandwaves with scales comparable\nto those of surface waves.

A comparative description of relativistic and classical\nmechanics is given using three main principles: the definition of momentum, the\nmain law of dynamics (Newton's second law) and the law of conservation of\nenergy. The difference of relativistic mechanics from classical mechanics is\ndue to the new definition of momentum that is proportional to energy and\nvelocity. It is shown that new relativistic laws of dynamics make it necessary\nto change kinematical relations of classical mechanics such as the law of\nvelocity composition, coordinate transformation etc. It is demonstrated that\nquantum mechanics may be considered as a rational statistical generalization of\nclassical mechanics.

In contrast to theoretical\nexpectation, resident bird species richness did not change significantly with\nelevation although the species composition changed substantially (<10%\nsimilarity) between the lowest and highest elevation sites.

Elevational range size of\nbirds, expected to increase with elevation according to Rapoport's rule, was\nfound to show a contrasting inverse U-shaped pattern because species with\nnarrow elevational distributions, including endemics, occurred at both ends of\nthe gradient (below 800 m and above 1,200 m).
