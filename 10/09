Here we show that the\ndeprojected positions of star-forming clumps in both galaxy types are\nexponential, as are the deprojected luminosity profiles of the total emissions\nfrom these clumps. These exponentials are the same for both types when\nnormalized to the outer isophotal radii. The results imply that clumps form or\naccrete in exponential radial distributions, and when they disperse they form\nsmooth exponential disks. The exponential scale lengths for UDF spirals average\n1.5 kpc for a standard cosmology. This length is smaller than the average for\nlocal spirals by a factor of 2. Selection effects that may account for this\nsize difference among spirals are discussed. Regardless of these effects, the\nmere existence of small UDF galaxies with grand-design spiral arms differs\nsignificantly from the situation in local fields, where equally small disks are\nusually dwarf Irregulars that rarely have spiral arms. Spiral arms require a\ndisk mass comparable to the halo mass in the visible region -- something local\nspirals have but local dwarfs Irregulars do not. Our UDF result then implies\nthat galaxy disks grow from the inside out, starting with a dense halo and\ndense disk that can form spiral arms, and then adding lower density halo and\ndisk material over time. Bars that form early in such small, dense, gas-rich\ndisks should disperse more quickly than bars that form later in fully developed\ndisks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2005 02:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In the rational\nparaxial approximation, the Talbot images are formed at distances z=p/q, where\np and q are coprimes, and are superpositions of q equally spaced images of the\noriginal binary transmission (Ronchi) grating. This interpretation offers the\npossibility to express the Talbot effect through Gauss sums. Here, we pay\nattention to the Talbot effect in the case of dispersion in optical fibers\npresenting our considerations based on the close relationships of the\nmathematical representations of diffraction and dispersion. Although dispersion\ndeals with continuous functions, such as gaussian and supergaussian pulses,\nwhereas in diffraction one frequently deals with discontinuous functions, the\nmathematical correspondence enables one to characterize the Talbot effect in\nthe two cases with minor differences. In addition, we apply, for the first time\nto our knowledge, the wavelet transform to the fractal Talbot effect in both\ndiffraction and fiber dispersion. In the first case, the self similar character\nof the transverse paraxial field at irrational multiples of the Talbot distance\nis confirmed, whereas in the second case it is shown that the field is not self\nsimilar for supergaussian pulses. Finally, a high-precision measurement of\nirrational distances employing the fractal index determined with the wavelet\ntransform is pointed out\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2005 16:59:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2005 20:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In a nutshell, according to this view, being competitively\nselfish adds value for all. But to what degree can doing good add competitive\nvalue to products and services?
