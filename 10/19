At a\nstellocentric distance r = r_BR = 43 AU, we posit a ring of parent bodies on\ncircular orbits: the \"birth ring,\" wherein micron-sized grains are born from\nthe collisional attrition of parent bodies.

How the vertical optical depth tau scales with r depends on\nthe fraction of grains that migrate inward by CPR drag without suffering a\ncollision. If this fraction is large, the inner disk and birth ring share the\nsame optical depth, and tau scales as r^-5/2 in the outer disk. By contrast,\nunder collision-dominated conditions, the inner disk is empty, and tau scales\nas r^-3/2 outside.

Models of very low $Z$ experience a much stronger internal mixing in all\nphases than at solar $Z$. Also, rotating models at very low $Z$, contrary to\nthe usual considerations, show a large mass loss, which mainly results from the\nefficient mixing of the products of the 3$\\alpha$ reaction into the H--burning\nshell. This mixing allows convective dredge--up to enrich the stellar surface\nin heavy elements during the red supergiant phase, which in turn favours a\nlarge loss of mass by stellar winds, especially as rotation also increases the\nduration of this phase. On the whole, the low $Z$ stars may lose about half of\ntheir mass. Massive stars initially rotating at half of their critical velocity\nare likely to avoid the pair--instability supernova. The chemical composition\nof the rotationally enhanced winds of very low $Z$ stars show large CNO\nenhancements by factors of $10^3$ to $10^7$, together with large excesses of\n$^{13}$C and $^{17}$O and moderate amounts of Na and Al.

Field equations are\nset up and an attempt is made to find an approximate series solution for the\nexterior part. However, the result is that no stationary solution corresponding\nto a spinning source can exist when considering terms beyond a certain order in\nsmall quantities. That is, except for metrically static systems, axially\nsymmetric systems must necessarily be non-stationary in quasi-metric gravity.\nHowever, sufficiently weak, axially symmetric gravitational fields associated\nwith slowly rotating sources, may still be considered as stationary as an\nexcellent approximation.\n  Thus a truncated, approximately stationary solution is found for the exterior\nfield.

Normally, it is supposed to be a\ngeometrical field, but interestingly it also behaves like a physical field.\nThus it plays dual role in the arena of gravitation. This article is an\noverview of the work related to dual roles of the Ricci scalar. A scalar is a\nmathematical concept representing a spinless particle.Here, particle concept,\nmanifesting the physical aspect of the Ricci scalar, is termed as riccion.It is\na scalar particle with (mass)$^2$ inversely proportional to the gravitational\nconstant. Many intereseting consequences of dual role of the Ricci scalar are\ndiscussed here. It causes inflationary scenario in the early universe without\ntaking another scalar like ``inflaton''. It is found that a riccion behaves\nlike an instanton also. This feature inspires``primordial inflation''.It is\ninteresting to see that a riccion, obtained from higher-dimensional space-time,\ndecouples into fermion and anti-fermion pair, if parity is violated. One-loop\nrenormalization of riccion indicates fractal geometry at high\nenergy.Homogeneous and inhomogeneous models of the early universe are derived\nusing dual role of the Ricci scalar. Production of spinless and spin-1/2\nparticles, due to riccion coupling, is discussed here. Contribution of riccion\nto the cosmic dark energy is obtained here through one-loop renormalization and\nit is shown that dark energy decays to dark matter during expansion of the\nuniverse.

Understanding\nthis filtering is crucial to relate LFP signals with neuronal activity, but not\nmuch is known about the exact mechanisms underlying this low-pass filtering. In\nthis paper, we investigate a possible biophysical mechanism for the low-pass\nfiltering properties of LFPs.

We take into account the\npresence of a high density of cellular membranes around current sources, such\nas glial cells. By considering them as passive cells, we show that under the\ninfluence of the electric source field, they respond by polarisation, i.e.,\ncreation of an induced field. Because of the finite velocity of ionic charge\nmovement, this polarization will not be instantaneous. Consequently, the\ninduced electric field will be frequency-dependent, and much reduced for high\nfrequencies. Our model establishes that with respect to frequency attenuation\nproperties, this situation is analogous to an equivalent RC-circuit, or better\na system of coupled RC-circuits. We present a number of numerical simulations\nof induced electric field for biologically realistic values of parameters, and\nshow this frequency filtering effect as well as the attenuation of\nextracellular potentials with distance.

Typically, this occurs when measured\ndata are concerned or data are evaluated numerically during the evolution of\npartial or ordinary differential equations. Usually, one does not take care for\naccuracy of the resulting estimates of derivatives because modern computers are\nassumed to be accurate to many digits. But measurements yield intrinsic errors,\nwhich are often much less accurate than the limit of the machine used, and\nthere exists the effect of ``loss of significance'', well known in numerical\nmathematics and computational physics.

Here we investigate the possibility that such response\nvariability might, in fact, be beneficial, because it may partially compensate\nfor a decrease in accuracy due to stochastic changes in the synaptic strengths\nof a network. We study the interplay between two kinds of noise, response (or\nneuronal) noise and synaptic noise, by analyzing their joint influence on the\naccuracy of neural networks trained to perform various tasks. We find an\ninteresting, generic interaction: when fluctuations in the synaptic connections\nare proportional to their strengths (multiplicative noise), a certain amount of\nresponse noise in the input neurons can significantly improve network\nperformance, compared to the same network without response noise. Performance\nis enhanced because response noise and multiplicative synaptic noise are in\nsome ways equivalent.

What is the neural basis of this flexibility? What mechanism is capable\nof selecting, in a context-dependent way, an adequate response to a given\nstimulus? One possibility is based on a nonlinear neural representation in\nwhich context information regulates the gain of stimulus-evoked responses. Here\nI explore the properties of this mechanism. By means of three hypothetical\nvisuomotor tasks, I study a class of neural network models in which any one of\nseveral possible stimulus-response maps or rules can be selected according to\ncontext.

In all cases, the contextual cues can quickly turn on or off a\nsensory-motor map, effectively changing the functional connectivity between\ninputs and outputs in the networks. The model predicts that sensory responses\nthat are nonlinearly modulated by arbitrary context signals should be found in\nbehavioral situations that involve choosing or switching between multiple\nsensory-motor maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2005 20:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Also this bias, though, is unlikely to be\nrelated to vectorial effects, since it correlates with subtle differences in\nthe primary sequence. These findings indicate that even if proteins aquire\ntheir structure vectorially no signature of this seems to be detectable in\ntheir average structural properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2005 07:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
