The accelerated particle spectra are\nderived by integrating the exact particle trajectories in a turbulent magnetic\nfield near the shock.

Formation of energetic spectral tails is\npossible in a limited energy range only for highly perturbed magnetic fields,\nwith cutoffs occuring at low energies within the resonance energy range\nconsidered. These spectral features result from the anisotropic character of\nparticle transport in the downstream magnetic field, where field compression\nproduces effectively 2D perturbations. Because of the downstream field\ncompression, the acceleration process is inefficient in parallel shocks for\nlarger turbulence amplitudes, and features observed in oblique shocks are\nrecovered. For small-amplitude turbulence, wide-energy range particle spectra\nare formed and modifications of the process due to the existence of long-wave\nperturbations are observed. In both sub- and superluminal shocks, an increase\nof \\gamma leads to steeper spectra with lower cut-off energies. The spectra\nobtained for the ``realistic'' background conditions assumed here do not\nconverge to the ``universal'' spectral index claimed in the literature.

Our\ninvestigation is based on direct numerical integration of initially circular\ntest-particle orbits. We examine a range of spiral strengths and spiral speeds\nand show that stars in this time dependent gravitational field can be heated\n(their random motions increased). This is particularly noticeable in the\nsimultaneous propagation of a 2-armed spiral density wave near the corotation\nresonance (CR), and a weak 4-armed one near the inner and outer 4:1 Lindblad\nresonances. In simulations with 2 spiral waves moving at different pattern\nspeeds we find: (1) the variance of the radial velocity, sigma_R^2, exceeds the\nsum of the variances measured from simulations with each individual pattern;\n(2) sigma_R^2 can grow with time throughout the entire simulation; (3)\nsigma_R^2 is increased over a wider range of radii compared to that seen with\none spiral pattern; (4) particles diffuse radially in real space whereas they\ndon't when only one spiral density wave is present. Near the CR with the\nstronger, 2-armed pattern, test particles are observed to migrate radially.\nThese effects take place at or near resonances of both spirals so we interpret\nthem as the result of stochastic motions.

In this paper we present a series of analytically solvable\nHamiltonians that approximate the Rabi Hamiltonian and compare our results to\nthe Jaynes-Cummings model which neglects the so-called counter-rotating term in\nthe Rabi Hamiltonian. Through a unitary transformation that diagonlizes the\nJaynes-Cummings model, we transform the counter-rotating term into separate\nterms representing several different physical processes. By keeping only\ncertain terms, we can achieve an excellent approximation to the exact dynamics\nwithin specified parameter ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2005 19:32:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2005 20:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

A transparency condition is derived between the cavity lifetime\nand vacuum Rabi frequency of the dipole. This condition is much weaker than\nstrong coupling, and amounts to simply achieving large Purcell factors. Thus,\nwe can observe transparency in the weak coupling regime.
