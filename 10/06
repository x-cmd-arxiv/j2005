In this paper we address two issues: Are there processes of\ncollisionless collapse that can lead to equilibria of the exceptional type?\nWhat is the intrinsic structural property that is responsible for the sometimes\nnoted exceptional stability behavior? To clarify these issues, we have\nperformed a series of simulations of collisionless collapse that start from\nhomogeneous, highly symmetrized, cold initial conditions and, because of such\nspecial conditions, are characterized by very little mixing. For these runs,\nthe end-states can be associated with large values of the global pressure\nanisotropy parameter up to 2K_r/K_T \\approx 2.75. The highly anisotropic\nequilibrium states thus constructed show no significant traces of radial\nanisotropy in their central region, with a very sharp transition to a radially\nanisotropic envelope occurring well inside the half-mass radius (around 0.2\nr_M). To check whether the existence of such almost perfectly isotropic\n\"nucleus\" might be responsible for the apparent suppression of the radial orbit\ninstability, we could not resort to equilibrium models with the above\ncharacteristics and with analytically available distribution function; instead,\nwe studied and confirmed the stability of configurations with those\ncharacteristics by initializing N-body approximate equilibria (with given\ndensity and pressure anisotropy profiles) with the help of the Jeans equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2005 21:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

Outbursts in systems of this type occur when\nthe accretion rate exceeds the upper limit of the steady burning range.\nTherefore, in order to realize the transition from a quiescent to an active\nstate it is necessary to find a mechanism able to sufficiently increase the\naccretion rate on a time scale typical to the duration of outburst development.\n  Our calculations have confirmed the transition mechanism from quiescence to\noutburst in classic symbiotic systems suggested earlier on the basis of 2D\ncalculations (Bisikalo et al, 2002). The analysis of our results have shown\nthat for wind velocity of 20 km/s an accretion disc forms in the system. The\naccretion rate for the solution with the disc is ~22.5-25% of the mass loss\nrate of the donor, that is, ~4.5-5*10^(-8)Msun/yr for Z And. This value is in\nagreement with the steady burning range for white dwarf masses typically\naccepted for this system. When the wind velocity increases from 20 to 30 km/s\nthe accretion disc is destroyed and the matter of the disc falls onto the\naccretor's surface. This process is followed by an approximately twofold\naccretion rate jump. The resulting accretion rate growth is sufficient for\npassing the upper limit of the steady burning range, thereby bringing the\nsystem into an active state. The time during which the accretion rate is above\nthe steady burning value is in a very good agreement with observations.\n  The analysis of the results presented here allows us to conclude that small\nvariations in the donor's wind velocity can lead to the transition from the\ndisc accretion to the wind accretion and, as a consequence, to the transition\nfrom quiescent to active state in classic symbiotic stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2005 13:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

In this paper, we present high-resolution,\nmid-infrared spectra of Betelgeuse recorded with the TEXES spectrograph. The\nspectra clearly show absorption features of water vapor and OH. We show that a\nspectrum based on a spherical, hydrostatic model photosphere with T_eff = 3600\nK, an effective temperature often assumed for Betelgeuse, fails to model the\nobserved lines. Furthermore, we show that published MOLspheres scenarios are\nunable to explain our data. However, we are able to model the observed spectrum\nreasonably well by adopting a cooler outer photospheric structure corresponding\nto T_mod = 3250 K. The success of this model may indicate the observed\nmid-infrared lines are formed in cool photospheric surface regions. Given the\nuncertainties of the temperature structure and the likely presence of\ninhomogeneities, we cannot rule out the possibility that our spectrum could be\nmostly photospheric, albeit non-classical.

Indeed,\nwe establish an extension of the partition theorem of Carlson about words and\nof the (more general) partition theorem of Furstenberg-Katznelson about\ncombinatorial subspaces of the set of words (generating from k-tuples of words\nfor any fixed natural number k) into a partition theorem about combinatorial\nsubspaces (generating from Schreier-type sets of words of order any fixed\ncountable ordinal). Furthermore, as a result we obtain a strengthening of\nCarlson's infinitary Nash-Williams type (and Ellentuck type) partition theorem\nabout infinite sequences of variable words into a theorem, in which an infinite\nsequence of variable words and a binary partition of all the finite sequences\nof words, one of whose components is, in addition, a tree, are assumed,\nconcluding that all the Schreier-type finite reductions of an infinite\nreduction of the given sequence have a behavior determined by the\nCantor-Bendixson ordinal index of the tree-component of the partition, falling\nin the tree-component above that index and in its complement below it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2005 17:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the case of DNA damage by\nradiation or chemicals, the damage checkpoints in the $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$\nphases of the cell cycle are activated. This results in an arrest of the cell\ncycle so that the DNA damage can be repaired. Once this is done, the cell\ncontinues with its usual cycle of activity. We study a mathematical model of\nthe DNA damage checkpoint in the $G_{2}$ phase which arrests the transition\nfrom the $G_{2}$ to the $M$ (mitotic) phase of the cell cycle. The tumor\nsuppressor protein p53 plays a key role in activating the pathways leading to\ncell cycle arrest in mammalian systems. If the DNA damage is severe, the p53\nproteins activate other pathways which bring about apoptosis, i.e., programmed\ncell death. Loss of the p53 gene results in the proliferation of cells\ncontaining damaged DNA, i.e., in the growth of tumors which may ultimately\nbecome cancerous. There is some recent experimental evidence which suggests\nthat the mutation of a single copy of the p53 gene (in the normal cell each\ngene has two identical copies) is sufficient to trigger the formation of\ntumors. We study the effect of reducing the gene copy number of the p53 and two\nother genes on cell cycle arrest and obtain results consistent with\nexperimental observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2005 11:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
