As a result, it is of\ninterest to explore the feasibility of methods that dramatically reduce the\nnumber of paths measured in such situations while maintaining acceptable\naccuracy.\n  We cast the problem as one of statistical prediction--in the spirit of the\nso-called `kriging' problem in spatial statistics--and show that end-to-end\nnetwork properties may be accurately predicted in many cases using a\nsurprisingly small set of carefully chosen paths. More precisely, we formulate\na general framework for the prediction problem, propose a class of linear\npredictors for standard quantities of interest (e.g., averages, totals,\ndifferences) and show that linear algebraic methods of subset selection may be\nused to effectively choose which paths to measure.
