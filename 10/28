We show that the shape of spectrum\nis not spoiled by differences in the Strehl ratio in the blue and in the red\npart, as well as differential refraction. We reanalyze the spectra and derive\nthe spectral type of the companion using classical methods. We find that the\nobject has a spectral type between M9V and L4V, which corresponds to a Teff\nbetween 1600 and 2500 K. Using GAIA-dusty models, we find that the spectral\ntype derivation is robust against different log(g)-values. The Teff derived\nfrom the models is again in the range between 1800 and 2400 K. While the models\nreproduce nicely the general shape of the spectrum, the 12CO-lines in the\nspectrum have about half the depth as those in the model. We speculate that\nthis difference might be caused by veiling, like in other objects of similar\nage, and spectral class. We also find that the absolute brightness of the\ncompanion matches that of other low-mass free-floating objects of similar age\nand spectral type. A comparison with the objects in USco observed by Mohanty et\nal. (2004) shows that the companion of GQ Lup has a lower mass than any of\nthese, as it is of later spectral type, and younger. The same is as true, for\nthe companion of AB Pic. To have a first estimate of the mass of the object we\ncompare the derived Teff and luminosity with those calculated from evolutionary\ntracks. We also point out that future instruments, like NAHUAL, will finally\nallow us to derive the masses of such objects more precisely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2005 08:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Recent\nsensitive observations have revealed that asymmetry of warps may be the norm\nrather than exception. However there exists no generic mechanism to generate\nthese asymmetries in warps. We have derived the dispersion relation in a\ncompact form for the S-shaped warps(described by the m=1 mode) and the\nbowl-shaped distribution(described by the m=0 mode) in galactic disk embedded\nin a dark matter halo. We then performed the numerical modal analysis and used\nthe linear and time-dependent superposition principle to generate asymmetric\nwarps in the disk. On doing the modal analysis we find the frequency of the\n$m=0$ mode is much larger than that of the $m=1$ mode. The linear and\ntime-dependent superposition of these modes with their unmodulated\namplitudes(that is, the coefficients of superposition being unity) results in\nan asymmetry in warps of ~ 20 - 40 %, whereas a smaller coefficient for the m=0\nmode results in a smaller asymmetry. The resulting values agree well with the\nrecent observations. We study the dependence of the asymmetry index on the dark\nmatter halo parameters. This approach can also naturally produce U-shaped warps\nand L-shaped warps. We show that a rich variety of possible asymmetries in the\nz-distribution of the spiral galaxies can naturally arise due to a dynamical\nwave interference between the first two bending modes(i.e. m=0 and m=1) in the\ndisk.

An optimal balance between the pinning and driving\nforce is needed to view the metastability effects in typically weakly pinned\nspecimen of low temperature superconductors. As one uses samples with larger\npinning in order to differentiate the response of different metastable vortex\nstates, one encounters a new phenomena, viz., the second magnetization peak\n(SMP) anomaly prior to the PE. Interplay between the path dependence in the\ncritical current density and the non-linearity in the electromagnetic response\ndetermine the metastability effects seen in first and the third harmonic\nresponse of the ac susceptibility across the temperature regions of the SMP and\nthe PE. The limiting temperature above which metastability effects cease can be\nconveniently located in the third harmonic data, and the observed behavior can\nbe rationalized within the Beans Critical State model. A vortex phase diagram\nshowing the different vortex phases for a typically weakly pinned specimen has\nbeen constructed via the ac susceptibility data in a crystal of 2H-NbSe$_2$\nwhich shows the SMP and the PE anomalies. The phase space of coexisting weaker\nand stronger pinned regions has been identified. It can be bifurcated into two\nparts, where the order and disorder dominate, respectively. The former part\ncontinuously connects to the reentrant disordered vortex phase pertaining to\nthe small bundle pinning regime, where the vortices are far apart, interaction\neffects are weak and the polycrystalline form of flux line lattice prevails.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2005 06:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The nicest\nfeature is that gauge symmetry itself protects the Higgs potential from\ndivergences, thus potentially curing the hierarchy problem in the Standard\nModel. In a flat space model tree-level contributions to electroweak precision\nobservables will be absent due to the flatness of the gauge and Higgs wave\nfunctions. The Higgs potential is fully radiatively generated and the\ncontribution of bulk fermions will induce a vacuum expectation value. A generic\nproblem is that the quartic scalar coupling is too low, resulting in a Higgs\nVEV that is too close to the compactification scale, and a Higgs mass that is\ntoo light. In this paper we show that it is possible to solve these problems in\na minimal scenario by cancellations in the Higgs potential between the\ncontribution of different bulk fermions. A crucial role is played by\nantiperiodic fermions: the cancellation is not the result of a fine tuning, but\nrather dictated by the choice of representations and parities of the fermions.\nWe also show that introducing a relatively large representation can help in\nachieving a sufficiently heavy top.

Furthermore, in the case where a reference alignment is\nnot available, we provide empirical evidence that the distance from an\nalignment produced by one program to predicted alignments from other programs\ncan be used as a control for multiple alignment experiments. In particular, we\nshow that low accuracy alignments can be effectively identified and discarded.\nWe also show that in the case of pairwise sequence alignment, it is possible to\nfind an alignment that maximizes the expected value of our accuracy measure.\nUnlike previous approaches based on expected accuracy alignment that tend to\nmaximize sensitivity at the expense of specificity, our method is able to\nidentify unalignable sequence, thereby increasing overall accuracy.
