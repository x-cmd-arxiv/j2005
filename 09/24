Their origin and nature have\npuzzled the scientific community for about 25 years until 1997, when the first\nX-ray afterglows of long (> 2 s duration) bursts were detected and the first\noptical and radio counterparts were found. These measurements established that\nlong GRBs are typically at high redshift (z 1.6) and are in sub-luminous\nstar-forming host galaxies. They are likely produced in core-collapse\nexplosions of a class of massive stars that give rise to highly relativistic\njets (collapsar model). Internal inhomogeneities in the velocity field of the\nrelativistic expanding flow lead to collisions between fast moving and slow\nmoving fluid shells and to the formation of internal shock waves. These shocks\nare believed to produce the observed prompt emission in the form of irregularly\nshaped and spaced pulses of gamma-rays, each pulse corresponding to a distinct\ninternal collision. The expansion of the jet outward into the circumstellar\nmedium is believed to give rise to ``external'' shocks, responsible for\nproducing the smoothly fading afterglow emission seen in the X-ray, optical and\nradio bands. Here we report on the gamma-ray and x-ray observation of the most\ndistant gamma-ray burst ever observed: its redshift of 6.29 translates to a\ndistance of 13 billion light-years from Earth, corresponding to a time when the\nUniverse was just 700 million to 750 million years old.

Magnetic films are grown irreversibly by adding spins at the\nboundaries of the growing interface. A competing situation with two opposite\nshort range surface magnetic fields of the same magnitude is analyzed. Due to\nthe antisymmetric condition considered, an interface between domains with spins\nhaving opposite orientations develops along the growing direction. Such\ninterface undergoes a localization-delocalization transition that is identified\nas a quasi-wetting transition, in qualitative agreement with observations\nperformed under equilibrium conditions. In addition, the film also exhibits a\ngrowing interface that undergoes morphological transitions in the growth mode.\nIt is shown that, as a consequence of the nonequilibrium nature of the\ninvestigated model, the subtle interplay between finite-size effects, wetting,\nand interface growth mechanisms leads to more rich and complex physical\nfeatures than in the equilibrium counterpart. Indeed, a phase diagram that\nexhibits eight distinct regions is evaluated and discussed.
