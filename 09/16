Pulsational variation of the higher moments reveal substantial\ncontribution of the high-order (ell=3) spherical harmonics which appear due to\ndistortion of pulsations in HR 3831 by the global magnetic field.

Using this\nmethod, we find that the Derrida-Lebowitz scaling function (DLSF) properly\ncharacterizes the large system size limit (N-->infty) of a single particle\ndiscrete time system, even in the case of very small system sizes (N <= 22).\nThis fact allows us to not only verify that the DLSF properly characterizes\nmultiple particle discrete-time asymmetric exclusion processes, but also\nprovides a way to numerically solve for quantities of interest, such as the\nparticle hopping flux. This method can thus serve to further increase the ease\nand accessibility of studies involving even more challenging dynamics, such as\nthe open boundary ASEP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2005 16:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The analysis of\nsimple models with two competing states and a resistor network approximation to\ncalculate conductances has confirmed that CMR effects can be theoretically\nreproduced using non-uniform clustered states. In this paper, the recently\nproposed Truncated Polynomial Expansion method (TPEM) for spin-fermion systems\nis tested using the double-exchange one-band, with finite Hund coupling $J_{\\rm\nH}$, and two-band, with infinite $J_{\\rm H}$, models. Two dimensional lattices\nas large as 48$\\times$48 are studied, far larger than those that can be handled\nwith standard exact diagonalization (DIAG) techniques for the fermionic sector.\nThe clean limit (i.e. without quenched disorder) is here analyzed in detail.\nPhase diagrams are obtained, showing first-order transitions separating\nferromagnetic metallic from insulating states. A huge magnetoresistance is\nfound at low temperatures by including small magnetic fields, in excellent\nagreement with experiments. However, at temperatures above the Curie transition\nthe effect is much smaller confirming that the standard finite-temperature CMR\nphenomenon cannot be understood using homogeneous states. By comparing results\nbetween the two methods, TPEM and DIAG, on small lattices, and by analyzing the\nsystematic behavior with increasing cluster sizes, it is concluded that the\nTPEM is accurate to handle realistic manganite models on large systems.

It may also be\nbeneficial to practitioners to gain insights from different perspectives on the\ntheory. We will focus on the theoretical framework itself, rather than its\napplications, and do our best to write it in modern and precise langauge while\nkeeping the presentation accessible for beginners. After reviewing the\nclassical connection dynamical formalism of general relativity, as a\nfoundation, the construction of kinematical Ashtekar-Isham-Lewandowski\nrepresentation is introduced in the content of quantum kinematics. The\nalgebraic structure of quantum kinematics is also discussed. In the content of\nquantum dynamics, we mainly introduce the construction of a Hamiltonian\nconstraint operator and the master constraint project. At last, some\napplications and recent advances are outlined. It should be noted that this\nstrategy of quantizing gravity can also be extended to obtain other background\nindependent quantum gauge theories. There is no divergence within this\nbackground independent and diffeomorphism invariant quantization programme of\nmatter coupled to gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2005 02:19:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2005 04:26:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2005 16:50:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2005 15:49:17 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 17 May 2007 05:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-16"}

A comprehensive and unified picture for the phase\ntransitions from weak to strong coupling is presented. We first develop a\ntechnique to deal with the gap equation and neutrality constraints without\nrecourse to numerical derivatives, and show that the off-diagonal color\ndensities automatically vanish with the standard assumption for the diquark\ncondensates. The following are shown by the numerical analyses: (i) The\nthermally-robustest pairing phase is the two-flavor pairing (2SC) in any\ncoupling case, while the second one for relatively low density is the up-quark\npairing (uSC) phase or the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase depending on the\ncoupling strength and the value of strange quark mass. (ii) If the diquark\ncoupling strength is large enough, the phase diagram is much simplified and is\nfree from the instability problems associated with imaginary Meissner masses in\nthe gapless phases. (iii) The interplay between the chiral and diquark dynamics\nmay bring a non-trivial first order transition even in the pairing phases at\nhigh density. We confirm (i) also by using the Ginzburg-Landau analysis\nexpanding the pair susceptibilities up to quartic order in the strange quark\nmass.

In the present paper we reconsider a basic axiom of the\nstandard approach - the positivity of the measure. We introduce the so--called\npseudopositive measures instead. One of our main achievements is the solution\nof the moment problem in the class of the pseudopositive measures. A measure \\\n$\\mu$ is called pseudopositive if its Laplace-Fourier coefficients\n$\\mu_{k,l}(r) ,$ $r\\geq0,$ in the expansion in spherical harmonics are\nnon--negative. Another main profit of our approach is that for pseudopositive\nmeasures we may develop efficient ''cubature formulas'' by generalizing the\nclassical procedure of Gauss--Jacobi: for every integer \\ $p\\geq1$ we construct\na new pseudopositive measure $\\nu_{p}$ having ''minimal support'' and such that\n$\\mu(h) =\\nu_{p}(h) $ for every polynomial $h$ with $\\Delta^{2p}h=0.$ The proof\nof this result requires application of the famous theory of Chebyshev, Markov,\nStieltjes, Krein for extremal properties of the Gauss-Jacobi measure, by\nemploying the classical orthogonal polynomials $p_{k,l;j},$ $j\\geq0,$ with\nrespect to every measure $\\mu_{k,l}.$ As a byproduct we obtain a notion of\nmultivariate orthogonality defined by the polynomials $p_{k,l;j}$.
