The proposed\nweak-lensing observations with these facilities put the highest demands on\nimage quality over wide angles on the sky. It is particularly difficult to\nachieve a sub-arcsecond PSF on stacked images, where precise astrometry plays a\nkey role. Current astrometric standards are insufficient to achieve the science\ngoals of these facilities. We thus propose the establishing of a few selected\ndeep (V=25) astrometric standards (DAS). These will enable a reliable geometric\ncalibration of solid-state mosaic detectors in the focal plane of large\nground-based telescopes and make a substantial contribution to our\nunderstanding of stellar populations in the Milky Way. In this paper we\nmotivate the need for such standards and discuss the strategy of their\nselection and acquisition and reduction techniques. The feasibility of DAS is\ndemonstrated by a pilot study around the open cluster NGC 188, using the KPNO\n4m CCD Mosaic camera, and by Subaru Suprime-Cam observations. The goal of\nreaching an accuracy of 5-10 mas in positions and obtaining absolute proper\nmotions good to 2 mas/yr over a several square-degree area is challenging, but\nreachable with the NOAO 4m telescopes and CCD mosaic imagers or a similar\nset-up. Our proposed DAS aims to establish four fields near the Galactic plane,\nat widely separated coordinates. In addition to their utilitarian purpose for\nDAS, the data we will obtain in these fields will enable fundamental Galactic\nscience in their own right. The positions, proper motions, and VI photometry of\nfaint stars will address outstanding questions of Galactic disk formation and\nevolution, stellar buildup and mass assembly via merger events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2005 21:11:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

This results\nin a modulation of the gamma-ray flux as the relative positions of the\ngamma-ray source and companion star change with orbital phase. The lightcurve\nand spectrum of absorption provide useful diagnostics for the location and\nnature of gamma-ray emission. The expected orbital variations of the absorption\nspectrum and flux are calculated for LS 5039, PSR B1259-63 and LSI +61 303, a\nsystem similar to LS 5039 but still undetected at TeV energies. In LS 5039,\nemission close to a black hole or a neutron star primary is considered.

We observed the outburst in the radio with the VLA and MERLIN,\nin the optical both photometrically and spectroscopically, in the far\nultraviolet with FUSE, and in the X-rays with both Chandra and XMM. The\ntwo-year-long event had three distinct stages. During the first stage, the\noptical rise closely resembled an earlier, small outburst that was caused by an\naccretion-disk instability. In the second stage, the hot component ejected an\noptically thick shell of material. In the third stage, the shell cleared to\nreveal a white dwarf whose luminosity remained on the order of 10^4 Lsun for\napproximately one year. The eruption was thus too energetic to have been\npowered by accretion alone. We propose that the initial burst of accretion was\nlarge enough to trigger enhanced nuclear burning on the surface of the white\ndwarf and the ejection of an optically thick shell of material.

The influence of a time-dependent gravitational constant on\nthe gravity-driven collapse scheme with and without the presence of extra\ndimensions is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2005 23:12:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2006 19:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The invariant measures of the\nmulticlass systems are the same for both processes, and can be constructed as\nthe law of the output process of a system of multiclass queues in tandem; the\narrival and service processes of the queueing system are a collection of\nindependent Bernoulli product measures.

Each line of the multi-line process is\ngoverned by the dual points of the line below.

For each kind of\nintial state, we obtain the entanglement period and the entanglement critical\npoint, which are found to deeply depend on driving field density. In case of\natomic state $| ee >$, the entanglement can be induced due to STE. In case of\natomic state $| eg >$, there is a competition between driving field indued\nentanglement and STE induced entanglement. When two atoms are initially in $|\ngg >$, we can find a lumbar region where STE increases the amount and period of\nentanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2005 09:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

First, we summarise and extend recent work\ncategorising two different approaches to formalising multi-time measurements in\nquantum theory. The standard approach consists of describing an ordered series\nof measurements in terms of history propositions with non-additive\n`probabilities'. The non-standard approach consists of defining multi-time\nmeasurements to consist of sets of exclusive and exhaustive history\npropositions and recovering the single-time exclusivity of results when\ndiscussing single-time history propositions. We analyse whether such history\npropositions can be consistent with Bayes' rule. We show that certain class of\nhistories are given a natural Bayesian interpretation, namely the linearly\npositive histories originally introduced by Goldstein and Page. Thus we argue\nthat this gives a certain amount of interpretational clarity to the\nnon-standard approach.
