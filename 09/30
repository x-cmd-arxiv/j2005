The effective flux\nlimit of the survey is well matched to our deep 1.4-GHz image. The former is\nsensitive to luminous, dusty galaxies at extreme redshifts whilst the latter\nprobes the z<3 regime. A high fraction of our robust SMGs (~80%) have radio\ncounterparts which, given the ~10% contamination by spurious sources, suggests\nthat very distant SMGs (z>>3) are unlikely to make up more than ~10% of the\nbright SMG population. This implies that almost all of the bright SMG\npopulation is amenable to study via the deepest current radio imaging. We use\nthese radio counterparts to provide an empirical calibration of the positional\nuncertainty in SMG catalogues. We then go on to outline the acquisition of\nredshifts for radio-identified SMGs, from sample selection in the submm, to\ncounterpart selection in the radio and optical/IR, to slit placement on\nspectrograph masks.

These figures are consistent with previous estimates,\nsuggesting that our knowledge of the median redshift of bright SMGs population\nhas not been biased by the low significance of the source catalogues employed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2005 08:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

General\nrelativity is a deterministic theory but where the causal structure is dynamic.\nIt is reasonable to expect that quantum gravity will be a probabilistic theory\nwith dynamic causal structure. The purpose of this paper is to present a\nframework for such a probability calculus. We define an operational notion of\nspace-time, this being composed of elementary regions. Central to this\nformalism is an object we call the causaloid. This object captures information\nabout causal structure implicit in the data by quantifying the way in which the\nnumber of measurements required to establish a state for a composite region is\nreduced when there is a causal connection between the component regions. This\nformalism puts all elementary regions on an equal footing. It does not require\nthat we impose fixed causal structure. In particular, it is not necessary to\nassume the existence of a background time. Remarkably, given the causaloid, we\ncan calculate all relevant probabilities and so the causaloid is sufficient to\nspecify the predictive aspect of a physical theory. We show how certain\ncausaloids can be represented by suggestive diagrams and we show how to\nrepresent both classical probability theory and quantum theory by a causaloid.\nWe do not give a causaloid formulation for general relativity though we\nspeculate that this is possible. The work presented here suggests a research\nprogram aimed at finding a theory of quantum gravity. The idea is to use the\ncausaloid formalism along with principles taken from the two theories to marry\nthe dynamic causal structure of general relativity with the probabilistic\nstructure of quantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2005 18:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

The acceleration is produced by the body's\ngravitational self-force, which is constructed from the body's retarded\ngravitational field. The adiabatic approximation to the gravitational\nself-force is obtained instead from the half-retarded minus half-advanced\nfield; it is known to produce the same dissipative effects as the true\nself-force. We argue that the adiabatic approximation is limited, because it\ndiscards important conservative terms which lead to the secular evolution of\nsome orbital elements. We argue further that this secular evolution has\nmeasurable consequences; in particular, it affects the phasing of the orbit and\nthe phasing of the associated gravitational wave. Our argument rests on a\nsimple toy model involving a point electric charge moving slowly in the weak\ngravitational field of a central mass; the charge is also subjected to its\nelectromagnetic self-force. In this simple context the true self-force is known\nexplicitly and it can cleanly be separated into conservative and\nradiation-reaction pieces. We observe that the conservative part of the\nself-force produces a secular regression of the orbit's periapsis. We explain\nhow the conclusions reached on the basis of the toy model can be extended to\nthe gravitational self-force, and to fast motions and strong fields. While the\nlimitations of the adiabatic approximation are quite severe in a post-Newtonian\ncontext in which the motion is slow and the gravitational field weak, they\nappear to be less so for rapid motions and strong fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2005 19:48:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2005 19:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

By using comprehensive seismic catalogues we\nassess the net effect of seismicity on tidal relative sealevel measurements as\nwell as on the global oceanic surfaces, and we obtain an estimate of absolute\nsealevel variations of seismic origin.\n  Our results confirm that, on a global scale, most of the signal is associated\nwith few giant thrust events, and that RSL estimates obtained using tide-gauge\ndata can be sensibly affected by the seismic driven sealevel signal.\n  The recent measures of sealevel obtained by satellite altimetry show a wide\nregional variation of sealevel trends over the oceanic surfaces, with the\nlargest deviations from the mean trend occurring in tectonically active\nregions.

We not only re-derive the well-known condition for a set of errors to\nbe correctable with certainty, but also obtain a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the errors caused by a noisy channel to be correctable with any\nnonzero probability. Dense coding with a partially entangled state can also be\nviewed as an unambiguous unitary quantum channel when all messages are required\nto be transmitted with equal probability of success, the maximal achievable\nprobability of success is derived and the optimum protocol is also obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2005 22:55:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2008 12:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-14"}

This behavior has been\nconfirmed for the unconfined model systems and properly tuned initial data\n(maximally classical states). We provide two particular examples which indicate\na complexity of the quantum evolution.
