Using the model of Gromov-Witten theory, with this moduli\nspace replacing the space of stable holomorphic curves in a symplectic\nmanifold, we obtain invariants, which are (co)homology operations in M. The\ninvariants obtained in this setting are classical cohomology operations such as\ncup product, Steenrod squares, and Stiefel-Whitney classes. We show that these\noperations satisfy invariance and gluing properties that fit together to give\nthe structure of a topological quantum field theory. By considering equivariant\noperations with respect to the action of the automorphism group of the graph,\nthe field theory has more structure. It is analogous to a homological conformal\nfield theory. In particular we show that classical relations such as the Adem\nrelations and Cartan formulae are consequences of these field theoretic\nproperties.\n  These operations are defined and studied using two different methods. First,\nwe use algebraic topological techniques to define appropriate virtual\nfundamental classes of these moduli spaces. This allows us to define the\noperations via the corresponding intersection numbers of the moduli space.\nSecondly, we use geometric and analytic techniques to study the smoothness and\ncompactness properties of these moduli spaces. This will allow us to define\nthese operations on the level of Morse-Smale chain complexes, by appropriately\ncounting metric-graph-flows with particular boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2005 23:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Also used extensively are insights gleaned from a\nconvective variational action principle, key being the distinction between each\nvelocity and its canonically conjugate momentum.

An immediate goal of the investigation is to understand better the\nnumber, and form, of independent dissipation terms required for a consistent\nset of equations of motion in the multi-fluid context.

We assume that the genomes of the replicating organisms\nare two-chromosomed and diploid, and that the fitness is determined by the\nnumber of chromosomes that are identical to a given master sequence. We also\nassume that there is a cost to sexual replication, given by a characteristic\ntime $ \\tau_{seek} $ during which haploid cells seek out a mate with which to\nrecombine. If the mating strategy is such that only viable haploids can mate,\nthen when $ \\tau_{seek} = 0 $, it is possible to show that sexual replication\nwill always outcompete asexual replication. However, as $ \\tau_{seek} $\nincreases, sexual replication only becomes advantageous at progressively higher\nmutation rates. Once the time cost for sex reaches a critical threshold, the\nselective advantage for sexual replication disappears entirely. The results of\nthis paper suggest that sexual replication is not advantageous in small\npopulations per se, but rather in populations with low replication rates. In\nthis regime, the cost for sex is sufficiently low that the selective advantage\nobtained through recombination leads to the dominance of the strategy.

There is no requirement for\ndirect interaction between the qubits. Universal two-qubit quantum gates may be\neffected by schemes which involve measurement of the bus mode, or by schemes\nwhere the bus disentangles automatically and no measurement is needed.

We are given an oracle that knows\nall the entries of k matrices, that is, we can query the oracle an (i,j) entry\nof the l-th matrix. The goal is to test if each pair of k matrices commute with\neach other or not with as few queries to the oracle as possible. In order to\nsolve this problem, we use a theorem of Mario Szegedy (quant-ph/0401053) that\nrelates a hitting time of a classical random walk to that of a quantum walk. We\nalso take a look at another method of quantum walk by Andris Ambainis\n(quant-ph/0311001). We apply both walks into triangle finding problem\n(quant-ph/0310134) and matrix verification problem (quant-ph/0409035) to\ncompare the powers of the two different walks. We also present Ambainis's\nmethod of lower bounding technique (quant-ph/0002066) to obtain a lower bound\nfor this problem. It turns out Szegedy's algorithm can be generalized to solve\nsimilar problems. Therefore we use Szegedy's theorem to analyze the problem of\nmatrix set commutativity. We give an O(k^{4/5}n^{9/5}) algorithm as well as a\nlower bound of Omega(k^{1/2}n). We generalize the technique used in coming up\nwith the upper bound to solve a broader range of similar problems. This is\nprobably the first problem to be studied on the quantum query complexity using\nquantum walks that involves more than one parameter, here, k and n.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2005 05:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nentanglement of the two Kondo impurities is shown to be determined by two\ncompeting many-body effects, the Kondo effect and the\nRuderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, $I$. Due to the\nspin-rotational invariance of the ground state, the concurrence and negativity\nare uniquely determined by the spin-spin correlation between the impurities. It\nis found that there exists a critical minimum value of the antiferromagnetic\ncorrelation between the impurity spins which is necessary for entanglement of\nthe two impurity spins. The critical value is discussed in relation with the\nunstable fixed point in the two impurity Kondo problem. Specifically, at the\nfixed point there is no entanglement between the impurity spins. Entanglement\nwill only be created (and quantum information processing (QIP) be possible) if\nthe RKKY interaction exchange energy, $I$, is at least several times larger\nthan the Kondo temperature, $T_K$.
