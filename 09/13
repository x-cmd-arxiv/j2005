The initial configurations are assumed to be remnants of binary\nneutron star (NS) or NS+BH mergers and consist of a 4 solar mass BH with varied\nspin, girded by a torus with a mass between 0.01 and 0.2 solar masses.

Based on the\nstar formation rate of ~3 Msun/yr calculated from Lya, the lack of continuum\nemission could be explained if the galaxy is younger than ~2 Myr and is\nproducing its first stars.\n  Observations in V_606, i_775, and z_850 were used to identify additional\nLyman break galaxies associated with this structure. In addition to the radio\ngalaxy, there are 22 V-break (z~5) galaxies with z_850<26.5 (5sigma), two of\nwhich are also in the spectroscopic sample. We compare the surface density of\n2/arcmin^2 to that of similarly selected V-dropouts extracted from GOODS and\nthe UDF Parallel fields. We find evidence for an overdensity to very high\nconfidence (>99%), based on a counts-in-cells analysis applied to the control\nfield. The excess is suggestive of the V-break objects being associated with a\nforming cluster around the radio galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2005 21:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Many of these proposals solve the\nproblem of propagation of cosmic rays over cosmological distances by\nintroducing new physics. However these do not explain the origin of such high\nenergy cosmic rays. The possible astrophysics sites, such as active galactic\nnuclei, are highly constrained. Here we determine whether these cosmic rays\noriginated from the decay of some exotic objects, such as primordial black\nholes (PBHs), present in the early universe. In contrast to the usual Top Down\nscenario we do not assume that this exotic object necessarily has to decay in\nour astrophysical neighbourhood since we assume a beyond the standard model\nscenario, where the propagation problem is absent. We consider the standard\n4-dimension PBHs as well as the brane world PBHs. We find that in both cases it\nis unable to produce the observed ultra high energy cosmic ray flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2005 11:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

(i) The full spacetime is higher\ndimensional, with (possibly) compact extra-dimensions; (ii) There is a natural\nminimal length below which the concept of continuum spacetime needs to be\nmodified by some deeper concept. On the other hand, the existence of a minimal\nlength (or zero-point length) in four-dimensional spacetime, with obvious\nimplications as UV regulator, has been often conjectured as a natural aftermath\nof any correct quantum theory of gravity. We show that one can incorporate the\napparently unrelated pieces of information - zero-point length,\nextra-dimensions, string T-duality - in a consistent framework. This is done in\nterms of a modified Kaluza-Klein theory that interpolates between (high-energy)\nstring theory and (low-energy) quantum field theory. In this model, the\nzero-point length in four dimensions is a ``virtual memory'' of the length\nscale of compact extra-dimensions.\n  Such a scale turns out to be determined by T-duality inherited from the\nunderlying fundamental string theory. From a low energy perspective short\ndistance infinities are cut off by a minimal length which is proportional to\nthe square root of the string slope, i.e. \\sqrt{\\alpha^\\prime}. Thus, we bridge\nthe gap between the string theory domain and the low energy arena of\npoint-particle quantum field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2005 13:29:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2005 11:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

In media containing more than one\ngrowth-limiting substrate, multiple species can coexist. The question then\narises: Can single-species data predict the existence and stability of\nmixed-culture steady states in mixed-substrate environments? This question has\nbeen extensively studied with the help of resource-based models. These studies\nhave shown that the single-species data required to predict mixed-culture\nbehavior consists of the growth isoclines and consumption vectors, which in\nturn are determined from single-substrate data by making specific assumptions\nabout the kinetics of mixed-substrate growth. Here, we show that these\nassumptions are not valid for microbial growth on mixtures of substitutable\nsubstrates. However, the theory can be developed by determining the growth\nisoclines and consumption vectors directly from the mixed-substrate data, thus\nobviating the need for specific assumptions about the kinetics of\nmixed-substrate growth. We show furthermore that in addition to the growth\nisoclines and consumption vectors, the single-species, mixed-substrate data\nyields a new family of curves, which we call the consumption curves.\nConsideration of the growth isoclines and the consumption curves yields deeper\ninsights into the behavior of the mixed cultures.

It can be shown that a univariate spin distribution is never\nsqueezed and one needs to look into either bivariate or trivariate\ndistributions for signatures of squeezing. Several such distributions result if\none considers different characteristic functions or moments based on various\ncorrespondence rules. As an example, discrete probability distribution for an\narbitrary spin-1 assembly is constructed using Wigner-Weyl and Margenau-Hill\ncorrespondence rules. It is also shown that a trivariate spin-1 assembly\nresulting from the exposure of nucleus with non-zero quadrupole moment to\ncombined electric quadrupole field and dipole magnetic field exhibits squeezing\nin cerain cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2005 09:10:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2005 06:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Given an imperfect source and a very lossy\nchannel, the photon-number-splitting (PNS) attack can make the quantum key\ndistribution (QKD) in practice totally insecure. Given the result of ILM-GLLP,\none knows how to distill the secure final key if he knows the fraction of\ntagged bits. The purpose of decoy state method is to do a tight verification of\nthe the fraction of tagged bits. The main idea of decoy-state method is\nchanging the intensities of source light and one can verify the fraction of\ntagged bits of certain intensity by watching the the counting rates of pulses\nof different intensities. Since the counting rates are small quantities, the\neffect of statistical fluctuation is very important.
