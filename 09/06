We compare this luminosity upper limit to the quiescent\nluminosities of 19 neutron star and 14 black hole systems and discuss the\nresults in the context of the differences between neutron stars and black\nholes.

The position of the possible\nX-ray counterpart is consistent with three blended optical/IR sources with\nR-magnitudes between 19.4 and 19.8 and J-magnitudes between 17.2 and 17.6.

But another overlooked mechanism, the transfer of angular\nmomentum from the infalling gas to the stellar bar, can also strongly weaken\nthe bar. In addition, we show that gravity torques are correctly reproduced in\nsimulations, and conclude that bars are transient features, with life-time of\n1-2 Gyr in typical Sb-Sc galaxies, because of the combined effects of CMCs and\ngravity torques, while most existing works had focussed on the CMC effects\nalone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2005 14:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Various low temperature transport regimes in\ntrue-metallic, small and large bandgap semiconducting nanotubes are observed\nincluding quantum states shell-filling, -splitting and -crossing in magnetic\nfields for medium conductance devices. The clean transport data reveals a\ncorrelation between the contact junction resistance and the various transport\nregimes in SWNT devices.

The kinematics of the electron\nand the nucleus is chosen to be non-relativistic, and their spins are\nneglected. In a simplified model of a hydrogen atom or a one-electron ion\ninteracting with the quantized radiation field in which the helicity of photons\nis neglected and the interactions between photons and the electron and nucleus\nare turned off at very high photon energies and at photon energies below an\narbitrarily small, but fixed energy (infrared cutoff), asymptotic completeness\nof Rayleigh scattering is established rigorously. On the way towards proving\nthis result, it is shown that, after coupling the electron and the nucleus to\nthe photons, the atom still has a stable ground state, provided its center of\nmass velocity is smaller than the velocity of light; but its excited states are\nturned into resonances. The proof of asymptotic completeness then follows from\nextensions of a positive commutator method and of propagation estimates for the\natom and the photons developed in previous papers.\n  The methods developed in this paper can be extended to more realistic models.\nIt is, however, not known, at present, how to remove the infrared cutoff.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2005 16:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A\nsimplified scenario for the introduction of fluctuations beyond mean-field is\nfirst presented. In this theory, part of the quantum correlations between the\nresidual interaction and the one-body density matrix are neglected and jumps\noccur between many-body densities formed of pairs of states $D=| \\Phi_a > <\n\\Phi_b |/< \\Phi_b . |\\Phi_a >$ where $| \\Phi_a >$ and $| \\Phi_b >$ are\nantisymmetrized products of single-particle states. The underlying Stochastic\nMean-Field (SMF) theory is discussed and applied to the monopole vibration of a\nspherical $^{40}$Ca nucleus under the influence of a statistical ensemble of\ntwo-body contact interaction. This framework is however too simplistic to\naccount for both fluctuation and dissipation. In the second part of this work,\nan alternative quantum jump method is obtained without making the approximation\non quantum correlations. Restricting to two particles-two holes residual\ninteraction, the evolution of the one-body density matrix of a correlated\nsystem is transformed into a Lindblad equation. The associated dissipative\ndynamics can be simulated by quantum jumps between densities written as $D = |\n\\Phi >< \\Phi |$ where $| \\Phi >$ is a normalized Slater determinant. The\nassociated stochastic Schroedinger equation for single-particle wave-functions\nis given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2005 09:26:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2006 15:47:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
