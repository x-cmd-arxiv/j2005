Using techniques of\ndeformation theory on representations of quivers, we exhibit families of linear\nfree divisors as discriminants in representation spaces for real Schur roots of\na finite quiver. We review some basic material on quiver representations, and\nexplain in detail how to verify whether the discriminant is a free divisor and\nhow to determine its components and their equations, using techniques of A.\nSchofield. As an illustration, the linear free divisors that arise as the\ndiscriminant from the highest roots of Dynkin quivers of type E7 and E8 are\ntreated explicitly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2005 17:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
