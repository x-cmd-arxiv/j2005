Above z=0.5, roughly half of all LIRGs are spiral, the\npeculiar/irregular to spiral ratio is ~0.7, and both classes span a similar\nrange of L_{IR} and M_B. At low-z, spirals account for one-third of LIRGs, the\npeculiar to spiral fraction rises to 1.3, and for a given M_B spirals tend to\nhave lower IR luminosity than peculiars. Only a few percent of LIRGs at any\nredshift are red early-type galaxies. For blue galaxies (U-B < 0.2), M_B is\nwell correlated with log(L_{IR}) with an RMS scatter (about a bivariate linear\nfit) of ~0.25 dex in IR luminosity. Among blue galaxies that are brighter than\nM_B = -21, 75% are LIRGs, regardless of redshift. These results can be\nexplained by a scenario in which at high-z, most large spirals experience an\nelevated star formation rate as LIRGs. Gas consumption results in a decline of\nLIRGs, especially in spirals, to lower redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2005 23:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
