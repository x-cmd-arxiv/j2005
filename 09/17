The gauge theory in question is found on N D3-branes\nplaced at the tip of the cone R^6/Gamma. In our previous work we showed that,\nwhen the orbifold group Gamma breaks all supersymmetry, then typically the\ngauge theory is not conformal because of double-trace couplings whose one-loop\nbeta functions do not possess real zeros. In this paper we observe a precise\ncorrespondence between the instabilities caused by the flow of these\ndouble-trace couplings and the presence of tachyons in the twisted sectors of\ntype IIB theory on orbifolds R^{3,1}x R^6/Gamma. For each twisted sectors that\ndoes not contain tachyons, we show that the corresponding double-trace coupling\nflows to a fixed point and does not cause an instability. However, whenever a\ntwisted sector is tachyonic, we find that the corresponding one-loop beta\nfunction does not have a real zero, hence an instability is likely to exist in\nthe gauge theory. We demonstrate explicitly the one-to-one correspondence\nbetween the regions of stability/instability in the space of charges under\nGamma that arise in the perturbative gauge theory and in the free string\ntheory.
