Pressure measurements were done in a helium-gas pressure cell.\nBoth the thermal expansion and compressibility are very anisotropic, with the\nlargest effects along the c axis, as would be expected for a layered material\nwith weak hydrogen bonding nominally along the c axis. Near room temperature,\nthe anisotropies of the thermal expansion and compressibility of the hexagonal\ncrystal structure are nearly the same [(Dc/c)/(Da/a)=3-4], with a 100 C change\nin temperature being roughly equivalent to 0.2 GPa pressure. This would imply\nthat changes in atom position parameters are also the same, but this is not the\ncase. While the effects of temperature on the atom positions are essentially\nwhat one might expect, the effects of pressure are surprising. With increasing\npressure, the thickness of the CoO2 layer increases, due to the combined\neffects of an increasing Co-O bond length and changes in the O-Co-O angles of\nthe CoO6 octahedra. We conclude that this unusual effect results from\npressure-induced strengthening of the hydrogen bonding between the Nax(D2O)4x\nlayers and the CoO2 layers. The strengthening of these hydrogen bonds requires\nthat charge be moved from the somewhere else in the structure; hence, there is\na pressure induced charge redistribution that weakens (lengthens) the Co-O\nbonds and changes the electronic structure of the superconducting CoO2 layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2005 20:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

One argues that the terms containing the higher\ndimensional metric coefficients produces an extra negative pressure that\napparently drives the inflation of the 4D space with an accelerating phase. It\nis further found that in line with the physical requirements our model admits\nof a decelerating phase in the early era along with an accelerating phase at\npresent.Further the models asymptotically mimic a steady state type of universe\nalthough it starts from a big type of singularity. Correspondence to Wesson's\ninduced matter theory is also briefly discussed and in line with it it is\nargued that the terms containing the higher dimensional metric coefficients\napparently creates a negative pressure which drives the inflation of the\n3-space with an accelerating phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2005 11:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

From a rigorous viewpoint non coinciding upper and lower\nbounds on the critical line are known.\n  In this paper we combine numerical computations with rigorous arguments to\nget to a better understanding of the phase diagram. Our main results include:\n  - Various numerical observations that suggest that the critical line lies\nstrictly in between the two bounds.\n  - A rigorous statistical test based on concentration inequalities and\nsuper-additivity, for determining whether a given point of the phase diagram is\nin the localized phase. This is applied in particular to show that, with a very\nlow level of error, the lower bound does not coincide with the critical line.\n  - An analysis of the precise asymptotic behavior of the partition function in\nthe delocalized phase, with particular attention to the effect of rare atypical\nstretches in the disorder sequence and on whether or not in the delocalized\nregime the polymer path has a Brownian scaling.\n  - A new proof of the lower bound on the critical line. This proof relies on a\ncharacterization of the localized regime which is more appealing for\ninterpreting the numerical data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2005 14:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
