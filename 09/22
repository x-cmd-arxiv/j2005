The\ncolor distributions of individual GC systems are consistent with continuous\ntrends across galaxy luminosity, color, and stellar mass. On average, almost\nall galaxies possess a component of metal-poor GCs, with the average fraction\nof metal-rich GCs ranging from 15 to 60%. The colors of both subpopulations\ncorrelate with host galaxy luminosity and color, with the red GCs having a\nsteeper slope. To convert color to metallicity, we also introduce a preliminary\n(g-z)-[Fe/H] relation calibrated to Galactic, M49 and M87 GCs. This relation is\nnonlinear with a steeper slope for [Fe/H] < -0.8. As a result, the\nmetallicities of the metal-poor and metal-rich GCs vary similarly with respect\nto galaxy luminosity and stellar mass, with relations of [Fe/H]_MP ~ L^0.16 ~\nM_star^0.17 and [Fe/H]_MR ~ L^0.26 ~ M_star^0.22, respectively. Although these\nrelations are shallower than the mass-metallicity relation predicted by wind\nmodels and observed for dwarf galaxies, they are very similar to the\nmass-metallicity relation for star forming galaxies in the same mass range. The\noffset between the two GC populations varies slowly (~ M_star^0.05) and is\napproximately 1 dex across three orders of magnitude in mass, suggesting a\nnearly universal amount of enrichment between the formation of the two\npopulations of GCs. We also find that although the metal-rich GCs show a larger\ndispersion in color, it is the *metal-poor GCs* that have an equal or larger\ndispersion in metallicity. Like the color-magnitude relation, these relations\nderived from globular clusters present stringent constraints on the formation\nand evolution of early-type galaxies.

Towards Serpens SMM1, the most luminous sub-mm source of the\nSerpens cluster, the water maser emission comes from two small (< 5 AU in size)\nclusters of features separated by ~25 AU, having line of sight velocities\nstrongly red-shifted (by more than 10 km/s) with respect to the LSR velocity of\nthe molecular cloud. The two maser clusters are oriented on the sky along a\ndirection that is approximately perpendicular to the axis of the radio\ncontinuum jet observed with the VLA towards SMM1. The spatial and velocity\ndistribution of the maser features lead us to favor the interpretation that the\nmaser emission is excited by interaction of the receding lobe of the jet with\ndense gas in the accretion disk surrounding the YSO in SMM1.

This kind of asymmetry is well suited for neutron\nstars or white dwarfs possessing an inhomogeneous interior allowing for a\ndeviation from a perfectly spherically symmetric gravitational field. We show\nby a linear analysis that the disk initially in a cylindrically symmetric\nstationary state is subject to three kinds of resonances: a corotation\nresonance, a Lindblad resonance due to a driven force and a parametric sonance.\nThe highest kHz QPOs are then interpreted as the orbital frequency of the disk\nat locations where the response to the resonances are maximal. It is also found\nthat strong gravity is not required to excite the resonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2005 10:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A\npossible application is to look at a relation between the 2d anyon model and\nthe 1d Calogero-Sutherland model, which would allow for a better understanding\nof the connection between 2d anyon exchange statistics and Haldane exclusion\nstatistics. The latter is realized microscopically in the 2d LLL anyon model\nand in the 1d Calogero model. In a harmonic well of strength \\omega or on a\ncircle of radius R - both parameters \\omega and R have to be viewed as long\ndistance regulators - the Calogero spectrum is discrete. It is well known that\nby confining the anyon model in a 2d harmonic well and projecting it on a\nparticular basis of the harmonic well eigenstates, one obtains the\nCalogero-Moser model. It is then natural to consider the anyon model on a\nsphere of radius R and look for a possible dimensional reduction to the\nCalogero-Sutherland model on a circle of the same radius. First, the free\none-body case is considered, where a mapping from the 2d sphere to the 1d\nchiral circle is established by projection on a special class of spherical\nharmonics. Second, the N-body interacting anyon model is considered : it\nhappens that the standard anyon model on the sphere is not adequate for\ndimensional reduction. One is thus lead to define a new spherical anyon-like\nmodel deduced from the Aharonov-Bohm problem on the sphere where each flux line\npierces the sphere at one point and exits it at its antipode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2005 14:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Once again, in this case, we get a class of\nasymptotically shear-free null geodesic congruences depending on a complex\nworld-line in the same four-dimensional complex space. However in this case\nthere will be, in general, two distinct but uniquely chosen world-lines. One of\nwhich can be assigned as the complex center-of- charge while the other could be\ncalled the complex center of mass. Rather than investigating the situation\nwhere there are two distinct complex world-lines, we study instead the special\ndegenerate case where the two world-lines coincide, i.e., where there is a\nsingle unique world-line. This mimics the case of algebraically special\nEinstein-Maxwell fields where the degenerate principle null vector of the Weyl\ntensor coincides with a Maxwell principle null vector. Again we obtain\nequations of motion for this world-line - but explicitly found here only in an\napproximation.

At first order there is even the classical\nradiation-reaction term 2/3{q^{2}}{c^{-3}}ddot{v}, now obtained without any use\nof the Lorentz force law but obtained directly from the asymptotic fields\nthemselves.

The tachyon smears the brane and\nshifts the location of its tip. The Minkowski continuation of the hairpin brane\ndescribes a D0-brane freely falling in a linear dilaton background. Effects\nthat in Euclidean space are attributed to the tachyon condensate, give rise in\nthe Minkowski case to a stringy smearing of the trajectory of the D-brane by an\namount that grows as its acceleration increases.
