Our work is based on a combined sample of ~\n9000 galaxies from the FORS Deep Field and the GOODS-S field, providing high\nstatistical accuracy and relative insensitivity against cosmic variance. As at\nlower redshifts, we find that lower-mass galaxies show higher SSFRs than higher\nmass galaxies, although highly obscured galaxies remain undetected in our\nsample. Furthermore, the highest mass galaxies contain the oldest stellar\npopulations at all redshifts, in principle agreement with the existence of\nevolved, massive galaxies at 1 < z < 3. It is remarkable, however, that this\ntrend continues to very high redshifts of z ~ 4. We also show that with\nincreasing redshift the SSFR for massive galaxies increases by a factor of ~\n10, reaching the era of their formation at z ~ 2 and beyond. These findings can\nbe interpreted as evidence for an early epoch of star formation in the most\nmassive galaxies, and ongoing star-formation activity in lower mass galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2005 07:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-01"}

The lack of small-scale\nstructure in the broad emission-line profiles is consistent with a smooth gas\nflow, or a clumped flow with many small clouds. An attractive possibility for\nthe origin of many small clouds is the atmospheres of bloated stars, an origin\nwhich also provides a natural mechanism for the cloud confinement. Earlier\nstudies of the broad-line profiles have already put strong lower limits on the\nminimum number of such stars, but these limits are sensitive to the assumed\nwidth of the lines produced by each cloud. Here we revisit this problem using\nhigh-resolution Keck spectra of the H alpha line in NGC 4395, which has the\nsmallest known broad-line region (~10^14 cm). Only a handful of the required\nbloated stars (each having r~10^14 cm) could fit into the broad-line region of\nNGC 4395, yet the observed smoothness of the H alpha line implies a lower limit\nof ~10^4-10^5 on the number of discrete clouds. This rules out conclusively the\nbloated-stars scenario, regardless of any plausible line-broadening mechanisms.\nThe upper limit on the size of the clouds is ~10^12 cm, which is comparable to\nthe size implied by photoionization models. This strongly suggests that gas in\nthe broad-line region is structured as a smooth rather than a clumped flow,\nmost likely in a rotationally dominated thick disk-like configuration. However,\nit remains to be clarified why such a smooth, gravity-dominated flow generates\ndouble-peaked emission lines only in a small fraction of active galactic\nnuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2005 21:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Its\nessential physics is the separation of the gas phase from the liquid. Of\ncourse, boiling water is inhomogeneous and as such cannot be treated by\nconventional thermo-statistics. Then it is not astonishing, that a phase\ntransition of first order is signaled canonically by a Yang-Lee singularity.\nThus it is only treated correctly by microcanonical Boltzmann-Planck\nstatistics. This is elaborated in the present paper. It turns out that the\nBoltzmann-Planck statistics is much richer and gives fundamental insight into\nstatistical mechanics and especially into entropy.

The deep and essential difference between\n``extensive'' and ``intensive'' control parameters, i.e. microcanonical and\ncanonical statistics, is exemplified by rotating, self-gravitating systems.

Godel`s incompleteness theorem is taken into\naccount to construct a model of logical networks based on axioms obtained by\nsymmetry breaking. We start by saying that although an agent is rational, the\naxioms defining different agent's logic systems need not be the same although\nthey might have a large degree of overlap. This can be seen as each agent being\ncoupled to a higher dimensional world by means of his perception where the\ncouplings produce slightly different projections of the higher dimensional\nworld to each agent. The different projections would produce slightly different\nconcepts about the \"world\" to each agent and hence create a slightly differing\nset of axioms that each agent would use to act logically. Then we place the\nagents in an interacting logical network, where these axioms can be treated as\nspins that can be flipped as agents interact with each other and with the\nenvironment in which they are placed. Agents, who would share a common material\nworld that they wish to use or change by using different or conflicting sets of\naxioms will try to flip the other agent's axioms (This can be seen by observing\nthat as one agent acts to interact with his world as followed by his axiom,\nanother agent's world changes as well, and the change might be contradictory to\nthe second agent's \"axioms\" or \"optimal world\". We define an equation that\nallows an axiom to be flipped into an \"anti axiom (the opposite or conflicting\naxiom)\" as agents interact.
