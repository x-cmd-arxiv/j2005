First, it is quite easy to generate random instances of any arity\nsince no particular structure has to be integrated, or property enforced, in\nsuch instances. Then, the existence of an asymptotic phase transition can be\nguaranteed while applying a limited restriction on domain size and on\nconstraint tightness.
