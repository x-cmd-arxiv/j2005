Molecular motor proteins like, for example, kinesin and\ndynein, which are the vehicles of almost all intra-cellular transport in\neukayotic cells, sometimes encounter traffic jam that manifests as a disease of\nthe organism. Similarly, traffic jam of collagenase MMP-1, which moves on the\ncollagen fibrils of the extracellular matrix of vertebrates, has also been\nobserved in recent experiments. Traffic-like movements of social insects like\nants and termites on trails are, perhaps, more familiar in our everyday life.\nExperimental, theoretical and computational investigations in the last few\nyears have led to a deeper understanding of the generic or common physical\nprinciples involved in these phenomena. In particular, some of the methods of\nnon-equilibrium statistical mechanics, pioneered almost a hundred years ago by\nEinstein, Langevin and others, turned out to be powerful theoretical tools for\nquantitaive analysis of models of these traffic-like collective phenomena as\nthese systems are intrinsically far from equilibrium. In this review we\ncritically examine the current status of our understanding, expose the\nlimitations of the existing methods, mention open challenging questions and\nspeculate on the possible future directions of research in this\ninterdisciplinary area where physics meets not only chemistry and biology but\nalso (nano-)technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2005 13:36:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2007 02:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Our treatment is based upon the facts that (i) time appears\nin quantum theory as an external parameter to the system, and (ii) propositions\nabout the time-of-arrival appear naturally when one considers histories. The\ndefinition of time-of-arrival probabilities is straightforward in stochastic\nprocesses. The difficulties that arise in quantum theory are due to the fact\nthat the time parameter of Schr\\\"odinger's equation does not naturally define a\nprobability density at the continuum limit, but also because the procedure one\nfollows is sensitive on the interpretation of the reduction procedure. We\nconsider the issue in Copenhagen quantum mechanics and in history-based schemes\nlike consistent histories. The benefit of the latter is that it allows a proper\npassage to the continuous limit--there are however problems related to the\nquantum Zeno effect and decoherence. We finally employ the histories-based\ndescription to construct Positive-Operator-Valued-Measures (POVMs) for the\ntime-of-arrival, which are valid for a general Hamiltonian. These POVMs\ntypically depend on the resolution of the measurement device; for a free\nparticle, however, this dependence cancels in the physically relevant regime\nand the POVM coincides with that of Kijowski.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2005 17:01:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Oct 2006 15:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
