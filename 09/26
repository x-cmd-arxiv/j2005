M100 contains a nuclear ring of\nstar formation, fueled by gas channeled inward by the galaxy's bar. We present\nmaps of emission line strengths, absorption line strength indices, and the gas\nvelocity dispersion across the field. The H beta emission is strongest in the\nring, along two curved bar dustlanes and at the ends of the bar. The Mg b\nabsorption line strength shows a younger population of stars within the ring as\ncompared to the surrounding area. The gas velocity dispersion is notably\nsmaller than elsewhere in the field both in the ring and along the leading edge\nof the dustlanes. Low gas dispersion is correlated spatially with the H beta\nemission. We thus see stars being formed from cold (low dispersion) gas which\nis being channeled inward along the dustlanes under the influence of a large\nbar, and accumulated into a ring near the location of the inner Lindblad\nresonances. This lends further strong support to the interpretation of nuclear\nrings in barred galaxies as resonance phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2005 14:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

More precisely, there are two concepts of superselection rule, a weak\nand a strong one. Weak superselection rules exist both in orthodox quantum\ntheory and in Bohm-Bell theories and represent the conventional understanding\nof superselection rules. We introduce the concept of strong superselection\nrule, which does not exist in orthodox quantum theory. It relies on the clear\nontology of Bohm-Bell theories and is a sharper and, in the Bohm-Bell context,\nmore fundamental notion. A strong superselection rule for the observable G\nasserts that one can replace every state vector by a suitable statistical\nmixture of eigenvectors of G without changing the particle trajectories or\ntheir probabilities. A weak superselection rule asserts that every state vector\nis empirically indistinguishable from a suitable statistical mixture of\neigenvectors of G. We establish conditions on G for both kinds of\nsuperselection. For comparison, we also consider both kinds of superselection\nin theories of spontaneous wave function collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2005 16:59:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2006 15:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
