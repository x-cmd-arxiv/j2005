It turns out that the effect of the\nCoriolis force in stabilizing the flow depends on whether the flow is cyclonic\n(cooperating shear and rotation vorticities) or anticyclonic (competing shear\nand rotation vorticities); keplerian flows are anticyclonic. We have obtained\nthe following results: i/ The Coriolis force does not quench turbulence in\nsubcritical flows; ii/ The resolution demand, when moving away from the\nmarginal stability boundary, is much more severe for anticyclonic flows than\nfor cyclonic ones. Presently available computer resources do not allow\nnumerical codes to reach the keplerian regime. iii/ The efficiency of turbulent\ntransport is directly correlated to the Reynolds number of transition to\nturbulence $Rg$, in such a way that the Shakura-Sunyaev parameter $\\alpha\\sim\n1/Rg$. iv/ Even the most optimistic extrapolations of our numerical data show\nthat subcritical turbulent transport would be too inefficient in keplerian\nflows by several orders of magnitude for astrophysical purposes. v/ Our results\nsuggest that the data obtained for keplerian-like flows in a Taylor-Couette\nsettings are largely affected by secondary flows, such as Ekman circulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2005 12:48:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In this second paper, we focus on\nthe analysis of the optical light curve and on recent XMM-Newton X-ray\nobservations. In the optical, the system presents two eclipses, yielding an\ninclination i ~ 77degr. Combining the constraints from the photometry with the\nresults of our previous work, we derive the absolute parameters of the system.\nWe confirm that the two components of CPD - 41degr7742 are main sequence stars\n(O9 V + B1-1.5 V) with masses (M_1 ~ 18 Msol and M_2 ~ 10 Msol) and respective\nradii (R_1 ~ 7.5 Rsol and R_2 ~ 5.4 Rsol) close to the typical values expected\nfor such stars. We also report an unprecedented set of X-ray observations that\nalmost uniformly cover the 2.44-day orbital cycle. The X-ray emission from CPD\n- 41degr7742 is well described by a two-temperature thermal plasma model with\nenergies close to 0.6 and 1.0 keV, thus slightly harder than typical early-type\nemission. The X-ray light curve shows clear signs of variability. The emission\nlevel is higher when the primary is in front of the secondary. During the high\nemission state, the system shows a drop of its X-ray emission that almost\nexactly matches the optical eclipse. We interpret the main features of the\nX-ray light curve as the signature of a wind-photosphere interaction, in which\nthe overwhelming primary O9 star wind crashes into the secondary surface.\nAlternatively the light curve could result from a wind-wind interaction zone\nlocated near the secondary star surface. As a support to our interpretation, we\nprovide a phenomenological geometric model that qualitatively reproduces the\nobserved modulations of the X-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2005 12:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

The disk models we consider are conventional\nalpha-disks, which include viscous heating and radiative cooling. The primary\nsource of ionisation is assumed to be X-ray irradiation from the central star.\nWe consider a number of gas-phase chemical networks. In general we find that\nthe simple models predict higher fractional ionisation levels and more\nextensive active zones than the more complex models.

The static\nand dynamic nature of the ferromagnetic and reentrant spin glass phase has been\nstudied using DC and AC magnetic susceptibility. Characteristic memory\nphenomena of the DC susceptibility are observed at $T_{RSG}$ and $T_{c}$. The\nnonlinear AC susceptibility $\\chi_{3}^{\\prime}$ has a positive local maximum at\n$T_{RSG}$, and a negative local minimum at $T_{c}$. The relaxation time $\\tau$\nbetween $T_{RSG}$ and $T_{c}$ shows a critical slowing down: $\\tau$ with $x =\n13.1 \\pm 0.4$ and $\\tau_{0}^{*} = (2.5 \\pm 0.5) \\times 10^{-13}$ sec.

The graph theoretical indices revealed\ninternal cycles showing non-linear dynamics in the shallow lake ecosystem.

The steady state condition of the generic model was a\ncharacteristic turbid shallow lake ecosystem since there were no dynamic\nenvironmental changes that could cause shifts between a turbid and a clearwater\nstate, and the generic model indicated that only a dynamic disturbance regime\ncould maintain the clearwater state. The model developed herein captured the\nempirical behavior of shallow lakes, and contained the basic model of the\nAlternative Stable States Theory. In addition, our model expanded the basic\nmodel by quantifying the relative effects of connections and by extending it.\nIn our expanded model we ran 4 simulations: harvesting submerged plants,\nnutrient reduction, fish removal without nutrient reduction, and\nbiomanipulation. Only biomanipulation, which included fish removal and nutrient\nreduction, had the potential to shift the turbid state into clearwater state.\nThe structure and relationships in the generic model as well as the outcomes of\nthe management simulations were supported by actual field studies in shallow\nlake ecosystems. Thus, fuzzy cognitive mapping methodology enabled us to\nunderstand the complex structure of shallow lake ecosystems as a whole and\nobtain a valid generic model based on tacit knowledge of experts in the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2005 16:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-29"}

Taking the\ntrace instead over the system state space produces a different mapping which we\ncall the conjugate channel. We explore the properties of conjugate channels and\ndescribe several different methods of construction. In general, conjugate\nchannels map M_d to M_d' with d < d', and different constructions may differ by\nconjugation with a partial isometry.\n  We show that a channel and its conjugate have the same minimal output entropy\nand maximal output p-norm. It then follows that the additivity and\nmultiplicativity conjectures for these measures of optimal output purity hold\nfor a product of channels if and only if they also hold for the product of\ntheir conjugates. This allows us to reduce these conjectures to the special\ncase of maps taking M_d to M_d' with a minimal representation of dimension at\nmost d.\n  We find explicit expressions for the conjugates for a number of well-known\nexamples, including entanglement-breaking channels, unital qubit channels, the\ndepolarizing channel, and a subclass of random unitary channels. For the\nentanglement-breaking channels, channels this yields a new class of channels\nfor which additivity and multiplicativity of optimal output purity can be\nestablished. For random unitary channels using the generalized Pauli matrices,\nwe obtain a new formulation of the multiplicativity conjecture. The conjugate\nof the completely noisy channel plays a special role and suggests a mechanism\nfor using noise to transmit information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2005 15:55:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2005 18:18:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2006 00:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-14"}
