The\nproperties of early-type galaxies are weakly but significantly different in\nthese two extremes: objects in dense environments are less than ~1 Gyr older\nand alpha-enhanced by ~0.02 relative to their counterparts of the same velocity\ndispersion in less dense regions, but the metallicities show no dependence on\nenvironment.

Comparison to rotation laws in stars of\nspectral type A reveals that differential rotation sets in at the convection\nboundary in the HR-diagram; no star that is significantly hotter than the\nconvection boundary exhibits the signatures of differential rotation. Four late\nA-/early F-type stars close to the convection boundary and at vsini~100 km/s\nshow extraordinarily strong absolute shear at short rotation periods around one\nday.

The\nnon-detection of an optical counterpart to an upper limit of R=25.5, 1.20 days\nafter the burst, makes GRB 001025A a ``dark'' burst. Based on the X-ray\nafterglow spectral properties of GRB 001025A, we argue that some bursts appear\noptically dark because their afterglow is faint and their cooling frequency is\nclose to the X-ray band. This interpretation is applicable to several of the\nfew other dark bursts where the X-ray spectral index has been measured. The\nX-ray afterglow flux of GRB 001025A is an order of magnitude lower than for\ntypical long-duration gamma-ray bursts. The spectrum of the X-ray afterglow can\nbe fitted with an absorbed synchrotron emission model, an absorbed thermal\nplasma model, or a combination thereof. For the latter, an extrapolation to\noptical wavelengths can be reconciled with the R-band upper limit on the\nafterglow, without invoking any optical circumburst absorption, provided the\ncooling frequency is close to the X-ray band.

The effects of\ncooling in the cluster gas alter the radial profile of the X-ray and SZE\nsurface brightness outside the cool core region, leading to poor gas mass\nestimates in cool core clusters. Finally, we find that methods using a\nuniversal temperature profile estimate cluster masses to higher precision than\nthose assuming isothermality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2005 15:43:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2006 15:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Our results show that the classical waves\nmay follow a different scaling behavior from that for electrons.

We show that the power region is convex in linear and\nlogarithmic scale. It furthermore has a componentwise minimal element. Power\nconstraints are included by the intersection with the set of all viable power\nadjustments.\n  In this framework, we aim at minimizing the total expended power by\nminimizing a componentwise monotone functional. If the feasible power region is\nnonempty, the minimum is attained. Otherwise, as a solution to balance\nconflicting interests, we suggest the projection of the minimum point in the\npower region onto the set of viable power settings. Finally, with an\nappropriate utility function, the problem of minimizing the total expended\npower can be seen as finding the Nash bargaining solution, which sheds light on\npower assignment from a game theoretic point of view. Convexity and\ncomponentwise monotonicity are essential prerequisites for this result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2005 03:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

The idea behind this\nconstruction is that each M^3 might give rise to one large spatial dimension of\n4-dimensional spacetime in the closed string sector. In the open string sector,\nintersecting D6-branes can be constructed for the simple choice of an\norientifolded M^3=T^3 in a similar way as on the prominent T^6=T^2xT^2xT^2\nusing exact CFT. The D6-branes then are allowed to span general 2-cycles on\neach T^3. The intersection 1-cycles between two stacks of branes on one T^3 can\nbe understood as one spatial dimension of the effective 4-dimensional\n'spacetime' for the massless chiral fermions charged under these two stacks.\nAdditionally to the known solutions to the R-R tadpole equations conserving\n(3+1)-dimensional Poincare invariance, this allows for solutions with globally\njust (2+1)- or (1+1)-Poincare invariance. For non-supersymmetric solutions, a\nstring tree-level and one-loop potential for the scalar moduli (including the\nspacetime radii) is generated in the NS-NS sector. This potential here is\ninterpreted dynamically for radii and dilaton in order to describe the global\nevolution of the universe. In the late time picture, (3+1)-dimensional global\nPoincare invariance can be restored well within experimental bounds. This\napproach links particle properties (the massless chiral fermion spectrum)\ndirectly to the global evolution of the universe by the scalar potential, both\ndepending on the same topological wrapping numbers. In the future, this might\nlead to much better falsifiable phenomenological models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2005 13:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2005 15:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The accuracy of different\nsimulation approaches is discussed and it is verified that a careful choice of\napplied computational models and spectroscopic datasets yields precise\napproximations of the measured spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2005 11:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Cryo-electron microscopy has yielded a\nthree dimensional structure of the nAChR in its closed state. However, the\nexact nature and location of the channel gate remains uncertain. Although the\ntransmembrane pore is constricted close to its center, it is not completely\noccluded. Rather, the pore has a central hydrophobic zone of radius about 3 A.\nModel calculations suggest that such a constriction may form a hydrophobic\ngate, preventing movement of ions through a channel. We present a detailed and\nquantitative simulation study of the hydrophobic gating model of the nicotinic\nreceptor, in order to fully evaluate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that the\nhydrophobic constriction of the nAChR pore indeed forms a closed gate.\nPotential of mean force (PMF) calculations reveal that the constriction\npresents a barrier of height ca. 10 kT to the permeation of sodium ions,\nplacing an upper bound on the closed channel conductance of 0.3 pS. Thus, a 3 A\nradius hydrophobic pore can form a functional barrier to the permeation of a 1\nA radius Na+ ion. Using a united atom force field for the protein instead of an\nall atom one retains the qualitative features but results in differing\nconductances, showing that the PMF is sensitive to the detailed molecular\ninteractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2005 00:17:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2006 05:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

These LES\nhave evolved over myriad of generations to recognize and strongly attract each\nother, so as to make the protein fold fast and be stable in its native\nconformation.
