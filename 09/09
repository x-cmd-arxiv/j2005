This creates the possibility of\nparticle acceleration beyond the knee energy at ~10^15eV. The acceleration\nresults from a nonlinear modification of the flow ahead of the shock supported\nby particles already accelerated to the knee momentum at p ~ p_*. The particles\ngain energy by bouncing off converging magnetic irregularities frozen into the\nflow in the shock precursor and not so much by re-crossing the shock itself.\nThe acceleration rate is thus determined by the gradient of the flow velocity\nand turns out to be formally independent of the particle mean free path\n(m.f.p.). The velocity gradient is, in turn, set by the knee-particles at p ~\np_* as having the dominant contribution to the CR pressure. Since it is\nindependent of the m.f.p., the acceleration rate of particles above the knee\ndoes not decrease with energy, unlike in the linear acceleration regime. The\nreason for the knee formation at p ~ p_* is that particles with $p > p_*$ are\neffectively confined to the shock precursor only while they are within limited\ndomains in the momentum space, while other particles fall into\n``loss-islands'', similar to the ``loss-cone'' of magnetic traps. This\nstructure of the momentum space is due to the character of the scattering\nmagnetic irregularities. They are formed by a train of shock waves that\nnaturally emerge from unstably growing and steepening magnetosonic waves or as\na result of acoustic instability of the CR precursor. These losses steepen the\nspectrum above the knee, which also prevents the shock width from increasing\nwith the maximum particle energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2005 21:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A key feature of this theory is that the spatial extent of\ncritically long excitation chains diverges at the Vogel-Fulcher temperature.

Unlike the other Bianchi models of solvable type, the type VII$_0$\nstate space is unbounded. Consequently we show that, for a general\nnon-inflationary perfect fluid, one of the curvature variables diverges at late\ntimes, which implies that the type VII$_0$ model is not asymptotically\nself-similar to the future. Regarding the tilt velocity, we show that for\nfluids with $\\gamma<4/3$ (which includes the important case of dust,\n$\\gamma=1$) the tilt velocity tends to zero at late times, while for a\nradiation fluid, $\\gamma=4/3$, the fluid is tilted and its vorticity is\ndynamically significant at late times. For fluids stiffer than radiation\n($\\gamma>4/3$), the future asymptotic state is an extremely tilted spacetime\nwith vorticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2005 12:57:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2005 14:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The model of Berg and Kurland included four parameters,\nnamely, mutational inactivation, selection coefficient, population size, and\ntransmission rate.

This analogy facilitates the\napplication of many tools and concepts known from general relativity (such as\nhorizons) and the prediction of the corresponding effects such as the freezing\nof modes after horizon crossing and the associated amplification of quantum\nfluctuations. Basically the same amplification mechanism is (according to our\nstandard model of cosmology) supposed to be responsible for the generation of\nthe initial inhomogeneities -- and hence the seeds for the formation of\nstructures such as our galaxy -- during cosmic inflation (i.e., a very early\nepoch in the evolution of our universe). After a general discussion of the\nanalogy (\\emph{analogue cosmology}), we calculate the frozen and amplified\ndensity-density fluctuations for quasi-two dimensional (Q2D) and three\ndimensional (3D) condensates which undergo a free expansion after switching off\nthe (longitudinal) trap.
