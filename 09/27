These $e^\\pm$pairs could be\ntrapped in the region by the magnetic field in the GC, and cool through the\nsynchrotron radiation and Coulomb interactions with the medium.

The spiral shock forms dense clouds while dissipating kinetic energy,\nproducing regions that are locally gravitationally bound and collapse to form\nstars. The effect of the clumpiness of gas as it passes through the shock is to\ngenerate chaotic internal motions in the gas. The kinematics of these motions\nare found to agree with the observed velocity-dispersion/size relation found in\nstar-forming regions. In contrast to the standard picture where continuously\ndriven turbulence generates the density inhomogeneities in star-forming clouds,\nwe find here that it is the clumpiness of the interstellar gas that produces\nthe chaotic motions as it passes through the spiral shock and initiates the\nstar formation process. The velocity dispersion can be understood as being due\nto the random mass loading of clumps as they converge in the spiral shock. In\nthis model there is no need for any internal or external continuous driving\nmechanism for the 'turbulence'. The coupling of the clouds' internal kinematics\nto their externally triggered formation removes the need for the clouds to be\nself-gravitating. Indeed, while clearly some parts of the clouds are\nself-gravitating and able to form stars, most of the molecular material remains\ngravitationally unbound. This can provide a simple explanation for the low\nefficiency of star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2005 14:44:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Driven by the\nsurface fluctuations, the particles show a tendency to cluster, but the\nhard-core interaction prevents collapse. We use numerical simulations to\nmeasure the auto-correlation function in steady state and in the aging regime,\nand space-time correlation functions in steady state. We have also calculated\nthese quantities analytically in a related surface model. The steady state\nauto-correlation is a scaling function of t/L^z, where L is the system size and\nz the dynamic exponent. Starting from a finite intercept, the scaling function\ndecays with a cusp, in the small argument limit. The finite value of the\nintercept indicates the existence of long range order in the system. The\nspace-time correlation, which is a function of r/L and t/L^z, is non-monotonic\nin t for fixed r. The aging auto-correlation is a scaling function of t_1 and\nt_2 where t_1 is the waiting time and t_2 the time difference. This scaling\nfunction decays as a power law for t_2 \\gg t_1; for t_1 \\gg t_2, it decays with\na cusp as in steady state.

This index is calculated as the proportion of the\nhealth deficits in an individual. It is found, first, that frequency,\ntime-to-death, mortality-rate, and relative-risk-of-death exhibit remarkably\nsimilar FI- and age- patterns. Second, the FI, on the one hand, and mortality\nrate and relative risk, on the other hand, also exhibit similar age patterns\nwith accelerated increase up to oldest-old ages and with subsequent\ndeceleration and even decline. Third, distribution of the FI with time-to-death\nis sharper than that of age with time-to-death. These and related findings\nsupport the conclusion that the FI can describe aging processes and population\nheterogeneity. We also discuss the ability of the FI to capture physiological\nprocesses underlying aging both on individual and population levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2005 14:18:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Journal of Molecular Evolution (in\n  press)","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"q-bio.PE q-bio.GN","license":null,"abstract":"  The frequencies of A, C, G and T in mitochondrial DNA vary among species due\nto unequal rates of mutation between the bases. The frequencies of bases at\nfour-fold degenerate sites respond directly to mutation pressure. At 1st and\n2nd positions, selection reduces the degree of frequency variation. Using a\nsimple evolutionary model, we show that 1st position sites are less constrained\nby selection than 2nd position sites, and therefore that the frequencies of\nbases at 1st position are more responsive to mutation pressure than those at\n2nd position. We define a similarity measure between amino acids that is a\nfunction of 8 measured physical properties. We define a proximity measure for\neach amino acid, which is the average similarity between an amino acid and all\nothers that are accessible via single point mutations in the genetic code. We\nalso define a responsiveness for each amino acid, which measures how rapidly an\namino acid frequency changes as a result of mutation pressure acting on the\nbase frequencies. There is a strong correlation between responsiveness and\nproximity, and both these quantities are also correlated with the mutability of\namino acids estimated from the mtREV substitution rate matrix. We also consider\nthe variation of base frequencies between strands and between genes on a\nstrand. These trends are consistent with the patterns expected from analysis of\nthe variation among genomes\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2005 15:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
