The aim is to determine in which regions of the disk gas can couple to a\nmagnetic field and sustain MHD turbulence. We find that the effect of diffusion\ndepends crucially on the elemental abundance of heavy metals (magnesium)\nincluded in the chemical model. In the absence of heavy metals, diffusion has\nessentially no effect on the ionisation structure of the disks, as the\nrecombination time scale is much shorter than the turbulent diffusion time\nscale. When metals are included with an elemental abundance above a threshold\nvalue, the diffusion can dramatically reduce the size of the magnetically\ndecoupled region, or even remove it altogther. For a complex chemistry the\nelemental abundance of magnesium required to remove the dead zone is 10(-10) -\n10(-8). We also find that diffusion can modify the reaction pathways, giving\nrise to dominant species when diffusion is switched on that are minor species\nwhen diffusion is absent. This suggests that there may be chemical signatures\nof diffusive mixing that could be used to indirectly detect turbulent activity\nin protoplanetary disks. We find examples of models in which the dead zone in\nthe outer disk region is rendered deeper when diffusion is switched on. Overall\nthese results suggest that global MHD turbulence in protoplanetary disks may be\nself-sustaining under favourable circumstances, as turbulent mixing can help\nmaintain the ionisation fraction above that necessary to ensure good coupling\nbetween the gas and magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2005 16:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The galaxies span a wide range in mid-infrared\nproperties. Contrary to expectations, some of the galaxies emit strongly at 8\nmicron indicating the presence of hot dust and/or PAHs. The ratio of this\nmid-infrared dust emission to the stellar emission is compared with the\ngalaxies' luminosity, star-formation rate, metallicity, and optical reddening.\nWe find that the strength of the 8.0 micron dust emission to the stellar\nemission ratio is more strongly correlated with the star-formation rate than it\nis with the metallicity or the optical reddening in these systems. Nonetheless,\nthere is a correlation between the 8.0 micron luminosity and metallicity. The\nslope of this luminosity-metallicity correlation is shallower than\ncorresponding ones in the B-band and 3.6 micron. The precise nature of the 8.0\nmicron emission seen in these galaxies (i.e., PAH versus hot dust or some\ncombination of the two) will require future study, including deep mid-IR\nspectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2005 20:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Experiments demonstrate that the model accurately\nreproduces spectra of transitions from the upper hyperfine level of the ground\nstate only. Among these, the closed transition F -> F' = F + 1 dominates, with\na steep gradient through line center ideally suited for use as a reference in\nlaser locking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2005 16:21:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 2006 17:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
