Formation of energetic spectral tails is\npossible in a limited energy range for highly perturbed magnetic fields.\nCut-offs in the spectra occur at low energies in the resonance range\nconsidered. We relate this feature to the structure of the magnetic field\ndownstream of the shock, where field compression produces effectively 2D\nturbulence in which cross-field diffusion is very small. Because of the field\ncompression downstream, the acceleration process is inefficient also in\nparallel high-$\\gamma$ shocks for larger turbulence amplitudes, and features\nobserved in oblique shocks are recovered. For small-amplitude perturbations,\nparticle spectra are formed in a wide energy range and modifications of the\nacceleration process due to the existence of long-wave perturbations are\nobserved. The critical turbulence amplitude for efficient acceleration at\nparallel shocks decreases with shock Lorentz factor. We also study the\ninfluence of strong short-wave perturbations downstream of the shock on the\nparticle acceleration processes.

We have so far obtained\nnear-infrared high-resolution ISAAC spectra of 53 local ULIRGs at several\nmerger timescales and 12 Palomar-Green QSOs (more than half of which are\nIR-bright sources). We have extracted the stellar velocity dispersion and\nrotational velocity along our slits to derive the kinematics of the merging\ngalaxies. These quantities enable us to answer the following questions about\nthe evolution of ULIRGs: 1) What are the progenitor mass ratios?, 2) How do the\nstellar kinematics evolve?, and, 3) Is there a connection between ULIRGs and\nQSOs? We find that the Ultraluminous phase is mainly triggered by mergers of\napproximately equal mass galaxies, however, less violent minor mergers (of\nprogenitor mass ratio ~3:1) also exist in our sample. Dynamical heating of the\nmerging hosts is observed as the stellar systematic rotation decreases with\ntime in favour of the increase of random motions. The merger remnants, being\ndispersion-dominated systems with non-negligible rotation, resemble elliptical\ngalaxies. Placing ULIRGs on the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies shows\nthat they resemble intermediate-mass ellipticals. After the nuclear\ncoalescence, the black hole masses of ULIRGs, calculated from their relation to\nthe host dispersions, are of the order 10^7-10^8 M_sun. To investigate whether\nULIRGs go through a QSO phase during their evolution, we perform a similar\n(preliminary) analysis of the IR-bright-QSO kinematics.

We generalise previous\nresults to allow for scale-dependence of the scalar field power spectra and\ncorrelations that can develop between fields on super-Hubble scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2005 14:53:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2005 21:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A second crossover lengthscale is observed, which\ncorresponds to the typical time and length of heterogeneities, in agreement\nwith results from four point functions. The different regimes can be traced\nback in the behavior of the van Hove distribution of displacements, which shows\na characteristic exponential regime in the heterogeneous region before the\ncrossover to gaussian diffusion and should be observable in experiments.\n  Our results show that it is possible to obtain characteristic length scales\nof heterogeneities through the computation of two point functions at different\ntimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2005 13:20:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2006 17:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

In the case of nilpotent group by [Ks] we have, that if the number\nof generators of the free nilpotent class d group NF are bigger enough than d,\nthen Aut(AutNF)=Inn(AutNF). But we have no description of Aut(EndNF) and so can\nnot use the theorem of reduction. In this paper the method of verbal operations\nis used. This method was established in [PZ]. In [PZ] by this method was very\neasily proved that AutK=InnK in the case of free groups and in the case of free\nabelian groups. In this paper we will prove, by this method, that AutK=InnK\nfree nilpotent groups of arbitrary fixed class of nilpotency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2005 09:09:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2006 10:47:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2006 11:26:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2006 07:17:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We present a detailed study of the height process and of an associated\nmeasure-valued process called the exploration process, which plays a key role\nin most applications.

For order placement we show that the\nprobability of placing an order at a given price is well approximated by a\nStudent distribution with less than two degrees of freedom, centered on the\nbest quoted price.

A wide variety of 4-photon entangled\nstates as well as the N-photon W-state can be generated with an unexpected\nnon-monotonic decreasing probability of success with N.

In this paper, we provide the\noptimal trade-off between the approximation measure epsilon and the amount of\nclassical entropy used in the encryption of single quantum bits. Then, we\nconsider n-qubit encryption schemes which are a composition of independent\nsingle-qubit ones and provide the optimal schemes both in the 2- and the\noperator-norm. Moreover, we provide a counterexample to show that the\nencryption scheme of Ambainis-Smith based on small-bias sets does not work in\nthe operator-norm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2005 12:58:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2006 18:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Classical states are expected to be stable in\nspite of decoherence, and are thought to leave conspicuous imprints on the\nenvironment. Here these expected features of environment-induced superselection\n(einselection) are quantified using four different criteria: predictability\nsieve (which selects states that produce least entropy), purification time\n(which looks for states that are the easiest to find out from the imprint they\nleave on the environment), efficiency threshold (which finds states that can be\ndeduced from measurements on a smallest fraction of the environment), and\npurity loss time (that looks for states for which it takes the longest to lose\na set fraction of their initial purity). We show that when pointer states --\nthe most predictable states of an open quantum system selected by the\npredictability sieve -- are well defined, all four criteria agree that they are\nindeed the most classical states. We illustrate this with two examples: an\nunderdamped harmonic oscillator, for which coherent states are unanimously\nchosen by all criteria, and a free particle undergoing quantum Brownian motion,\nfor which most criteria select almost identical Gaussian states (although, in\nthis case, predictability sieve does not select well defined pointer states.)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2005 15:14:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2005 17:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
