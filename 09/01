This result clearly demonstrates that X-ray\nbinaries with relativistic jets (microquasars) are sites of effective\nacceleration of particles (electrons and/or protons) to multi-TeV energies.\nWhether the gamma-rays are of hadronic or leptonic origin is a key issue\nrelated to the origin of Galactic Cosmic Rays. We discuss different possible\nscenarios for the production of gamma-rays, and argue in favor of hadronic\norigin of TeV photons, especially if they are produced within the binary\nsystem. If so, the detected gamma-rays should be accompanied by a flux of high\nenergy neutrinos emerging from the decays of \\pi^\\pm mesons produced at pp\nand/or p \\gamma interactions. The flux of TeV neutrinos, which can be estimated\non the basis of the detected TeV gamma-ray flux, taking into account the\ninternal \\gamma \\gamma \\to e^+e^- absorption, depends significantly on the\nlocation of gamma-ray production region(s). The minimum neutrino flux above 1\nTeV is expected to be at the level of 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}; however, it\ncould be up to a factor of 100 larger. The detectability of the signal of\nmulti-TeV neutrinos significantly depends on the high energy cutoff in the\nspectrum of parent protons; if the spectrum of accelerated protons continues to\n1 PeV and beyond, the predicted neutrino fluxes can be probed by the planned\nkm^3-scale neutrino detector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2005 19:19:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2005 17:43:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 May 2006 18:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The hard\nX-ray emission component in the epoch-summed spectra can be well described\neither by phenomenological models, namely a cutoff power law in the hard state\nand a pure power law in the dim soft state, or by thermal Comptonization\nmodels. A soft thermal component is clearly present in the dim soft state and\nmight also contribute to the softer hard state spectra.

The mission ideas currently being proposed are based\non long focal length, grazing incidence, multi-layer optics, coupled with focal\nplane detectors with few hundreds microns spatial resolution capability. The\nrequired large focal lengths, ranging between 8 and 50 m, can be realized by\nmeans of extendable optical benches (as foreseen e.g. for the HEXIT-SAT, NEXT\nand NuSTAR missions) or formation flight scenarios (e.g. Simbol-X and XEUS).\nWhile the final telescope design will require a detailed trade-off analysis\nbetween all the relevant parameters (focal length, plate scale value, angular\nresolution, field of view, detector size, and sensitivity degradation due to\ndetector dead area and telescope vignetting), extreme attention must be\ndedicated to the background minimization. In this respect, key issues are\nrepresented by the passive baffling system, which in case of large focal\nlengths requires particular design assessments, and by the active/passive\nshielding geometries and materials.

We investigate the\ndependence of the baryon fraction upon the radiative cooling, star formation,\nfeedback through galactic winds, conduction and redshift. Both the cold stellar\ncomponent and the hot X-ray emitting gas have narrow distributions that, at\nlarge cluster-centric distances r>R500, are nearly independent of the physics\nincluded in the simulations. Only the non-radiative runs reproduce the gas\nfraction inferred from observations of the inner regions (r ~ R2500) of massive\nclusters. When cooling is turned on, the excess star formation is mitigated by\nthe action of galactic winds, but yet not by the amount required by\nobservational data. The baryon fraction within a fixed overdensity increases\nslightly with redshift, independent of the physical processes involved in the\naccumulation of baryons in the cluster potential well. In runs with cooling and\nfeedback, the increase in baryons is associated with a larger stellar mass\nfraction that arises at high redshift as a consequence of more efficient gas\ncooling. For the same reason, the gas fraction appears less concentrated at\nhigher redshift. We discuss the possible cosmological implications of our\nresults and find that two assumptions generally adopted, (1) mean value of Yb =\nfb / (Omega_b/Omega_m) not evolving with redshift, and (2) a fixed ratio\nbetween f_star and f_gas independent of radius and redshift, might not be\nvalid.

First, we\nreconsider Hawking's theorem and show that the integrated Ricci scalar\ncurvature with respect to the induced metric on the event horizon is positive\nalso in higher dimensions. Using this and Thurston's geometric types\nclassification of three-manifolds, we find that the only possible geometric\ntypes of event horizons in five dimensions are $S^3$ and $S^2 \\times S^1$. In\nsix dimensions we use the requirement that the horizon is cobordant to a\nfour-sphere (topological censorship), Friedman's classification of topological\nfour-manifolds and Donaldson's results on smooth four-manifolds, and show that\nsimply connected event horizons are homeomorphic to $S^4$ or $S^2\\times S^2$.\nWe find allowed non-simply connected event horizons $S^3\\times S^1$ and\n$S^2\\times \\Sigma_g$, and event horizons with finite non-abelian first homotopy\ngroup, whose universal cover is $S^4$. Finally, following Smale's results we\ndiscuss the classification in dimensions higher than six.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2005 15:38:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2005 08:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

With unbinned data, currently, the fitted\nparameters are obtained but no measure of goodness of fit is available. This\nremains, to date, an unsolved problem in statistics. By considering the\ntransformation properties of likelihood functions with respect to change of\nvariable, we conclude that the likelihood ratio of the theoretically predicted\nprobability density to that of {\\it the data density} is invariant under change\nof variable and provides the goodness of fit.
