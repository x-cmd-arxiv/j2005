At least in some polarized quasars, the\nemission lines are all unpolarized and so the polarized flux should originate\ninterior to the broad line region, and therefore also interior to the dust\nemitting region. This can then be used to eliminate the dust emission. We\npresent the results of near-infrared polarimetry for such three quasars\n(Ton202, 4C37.43, B2 1208+32). The data for Ton202 have the highest S/N, and\nthe near-infrared polarized flux in this case is measured to have quite a blue\nshape, nu^+0.42+-0.29 in F_nu, intriguingly consistent with the simple\nmulti-temperature black body, bare disk prediction of nu^+1/3.

Turbulence provides a natural means of\ndissipation and the removal of angular momentum, but firmly establishing its\npresence in disks proved for many years to be difficult. The realization in the\n1990s that a weak magnetic field will destabilize a disk and result in a\nvigorous turbulent transport of angular momentum has revolutionized the field.\nMuch of accretion disk research now focuses on understanding the implications\nof this mechanism for astrophysical observations. At the same time, the success\nof this mechanism depends upon a sufficient ionization level in the disk for\nthe flow to be well-coupled to the magnetic field. Many disks, such as disks\naround young stars and disks in binary systems that are in quiescence, are too\ncold to be sufficiently ionized, and so efforts to establish the presence of\nturbulence in these disks continues.\n  This dissertation focuses on several possible mechanisms for the turbulent\ntransport of angular momentum in weakly-ionized accretion disks: gravitational\ninstability, radial convection and vortices driving compressive motions. It\nappears that none of these mechanisms are very robust in driving accretion. A\ndiscussion is given, based on these results, as to the most promising\ndirections to take in the search for a turbulent transport mechanism that does\nnot require magnetic fields.

A grid of detailed binary evolutionary sequences has been\ncalculated and included in the simulations to take account of additional\nangular momentum losses beyond that associated with gravitational radiation and\nmass loss, due to nova outbursts, from the system. As a specific example, we\nconsider the effect of a circumbinary disk to gain insight into the ingredients\nnecessary to reproduce the observed orbital period distribution. The resulting\ndistributions show that the period minimum lies at about 80 minutes with the\nnumber of systems monotonically increasing with increasing orbital period to a\nmaximum near 90 minutes. There is no evidence for an accumulation of systems at\nthe period minimum which is a common feature of simulations in which only\ngravitational radiation losses are considered.

We test this idea by computing CXRB synthesis models with a ratio\nof Type 2/Type 1 AGN that is a function of both z and 2-10 keV X-ray\nluminosity, L_X. The evolutionary models are constrained by parameterizing the\nobserved Type 1 AGN fractions from the recent work by Barger et al. The\nparameterization which simultaneously best accounts for Barger's data, the CXRB\nspectrum and the X-ray number counts has a local, low-L_X Type 2/Type 1 ratio\nof 4, and predicts a Type 2 AGN fraction which evolves as (1+z)^{0.3}.

This very extended warp has large-scale\nsymmetry, which along with the rotation period of its outer parts (~1.5 Gyr at\n40 kpc), suggests a long-lived phenomenon.

The seeds\nof discord are the fundamental principles on which these theories are grounded.\nGeneral relativity, on one hand, is based on the equivalence principle, whose\nstrong version establishes the local equivalence between gravitation and\ninertia. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, is fundamentally based on the\nuncertainty principle, which is essentially nonlocal in the sense that a\nparticle does not follow one trajectory, but infinitely many trajectories, each\none with a different probability. This difference precludes the existence of a\nquantum version of the strong equivalence principle, and consequently of a\nquantum version of general relativity. Furthermore, there are compelling\nexperimental evidences that a quantum object in the presence of a gravitational\nfield violates the weak equivalence principle. Now it so happens that, in\naddition to general relativity, gravitation has an alternative, though\nequivalent description, given by teleparallel gravity, a gauge theory for the\ntranslation group. In this theory torsion, instead of curvature, is assumed to\nrepresent the gravitational field. These two descriptions lead to the same\nclassical results, but are conceptually different. In general relativity,\ncurvature geometrizes the interaction, while torsion in teleparallel gravity\nacts as a force, similar to the Lorentz force of electrodynamics. Because of\nthis peculiar property, teleparallel gravity describes the gravitational\ninteraction without requiring any of the equivalence principles.

Thus, it is very interesting that in the NMFV models\none is not forced to separate the scale of NP related to EWSB and the scale of\nflavor violation. We show briefly that this simple setup includes a wide class\nof supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models all of which solve the\nhierarchy problem. We further discuss tests related to Delta F=1 processes, in\nparticular the ones related to b -> s transition. The b -> s processes are\ncomputed using two different hadronic models to estimate the uncertainties\ninvolved. In addition, we derive constraints on the NP from B -> Kpi data using\nonly SU(3) flavor symmetry and minimal dynamical assumptions. Finally we argue\nthat in many cases correlating Delta F=2 and Delta F=1 processes is a powerful\ntool to probe our framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2005 19:49:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2006 16:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In contrast to recent attempts to realize scalar field\ninflation without potentials (such as k-inflation or ghost inflation), we find\nthat it is possible to obtain exponential inflation, without invoking any\nhigher derivative actions, or modifying gravity, and that unlike all previous\napproaches, we do not require a $\\rho = -p$ phase in order to realize\ninflation. The inflaton in our proposed framework is a scalar field with a\nquadratic kinetic energy term, but with the `wrong sign'. We take the\nperspective that this is due to some temporary instability in our system at\nhigh energies, and provide physical examples of situations where a modulus\nfield might temprorarily exhibit such behaviour. The deflation of extra\ndimensions is a neccesary feature of our framework. However, unlike in previous\nattempts at Kaluza-Klein inflation, it is possible to obtain exponential (as\nopposed to power law or pole) inflation. We provide several indications of how\none can gracefully exit from this type of inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2005 19:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Particular\nemphasis is laid upon the layered sine-Gordon (LSG) model, which is the\nbosonized version of the multi-flavour Schwinger model and approaches the sum\nof two ``normal'', massless sine-Gordon (SG) models in the limit of a vanishing\ninterlayer coupling J. Another model of interest is the massive sine-Gordon\n(MSG) model. The leading-order approximation to the UV (ultra-violet) RG flow\npredicts two phases for the LSG as well as for the MSG, just as it would be\nexpected for the SG model, where the two phases are known to be separated by\nthe Coleman fixed point. The presence of finite mass terms (for the LSG and the\nMSG) leads to corrections to the UV RG flow, which are naturally identified as\nthe ``mass corrections''. The leading-order mass corrections are shown to have\nthe following consequences: (i) for the MSG model, only one phase persists, and\n(ii) for the LSG model, the transition temperature is modified. Within the\nmass-corrected UV scaling laws, the limit of J -> 0 is thus nonuniform with\nrespect to the phase structure of the model. The modified phase structure of\ngeneral massive sine-Gordon models is connected with the breaking of symmetries\nin the internal space spanned by the field variables. For the LSG, the\nsecond-order subleading mass corrections suggest that there exists a cross-over\nregime before the IR scaling sets in, and the nonlinear terms show explicitly\nthat higher-order Fourier modes appear in the periodic blocked potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2005 07:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

A key tool is the multiplicity-polar theorem which\napplies to families of pairs of modules, linking the multiplicity at a general\npair of the family to the multiplicity of the pair at the special fiber.\n  The specific problem we work on is:\n  Suppose X,0 is an equidimensional complex analytic set in C^n, and T^*_X(C^n)\nis the closure of the conormal vectors to the smooth part of X, s, a section of\nT^*(C^n), the cotangent bundle of C^n restricted to X.

These\noperators cannot be elliptic and the relevant pseudodifferential calculus to\nstudy them is provided by the Heisenberg calculus. The aim of this monograph is\nthreefold. First, we give an intrinsic approach to the Heisenberg calculus by\nfinding an intrinsic notion of principal symbol in this setting. This framework\nallows us to prove that the pointwise invertibility of a principal symbol,\nwhich can be restated in terms of the so-called Rockland condition, actually\nimplies its global invertibility. Second, we study complex powers of\nhypoelliptic operators on Heisenberg manifolds in terms of the Heisenberg\ncalculus. In particular, we show that complex powers of such operators give\nrise to holomorphic families in the Heisenberg calculus and we construct a\nscale of weighted Sobolev spaces providing us with sharp estimates for the\noperators in the Heisenberg calculus. Third, we make use of the Heisenberg\ncalculus and of the results of this monograph to derive spectral asymptotics\nfor hypoelliptic operators on Heisenberg manifolds. The advantage of using the\nHeisenberg calculus is illustrated by reformulating in a geometric fashion\nthese asymptotics for the main geometric operators on CR and contact manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2005 04:25:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2005 05:50:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2005 06:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

The originality of this study comes from not only the\nanalysis of compact bone failure under dynamic loadings, the results of which\nare compared to those obtained under quasi static loadings but also the\ndevelopment of a statistical model. We developed a protocol using three\ndifferent devices. Firstly, an X-ray scanner to analyse bone density, secondly,\na common tensile device to perform quasi static experiments and thirdly, a\nspecial device based upon a hydraulic cylinder to perform dynamic tests. For\nall the tests, we used the same sample shape which took into account the\nbrittleness of the compact bone. We first performed relaxation and hysteresis\ntests followed by tensile tests up to failure. Viscous and plastic effects were\nnot relevant to the compact bone behaviour so its behaviour was considered\nelastic and brittle. The bovine compact bone was three to four times more\nbrittle under a dynamic load than under a quasi static one. Numerically, a\nstatistical model, based upon the Weibull theory is used to predict the failure\nstress in compact bone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2005 12:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Rev. Lett. 94 (2005), 184506; physics/0411050) it\nwas shown that a simple mean-field dynamo model with a spherically symmetric\nhelical turbulence parameter alpha can exhibit a number of features which are\ntypical for Earth's magnetic field reversals. In particular, the model produces\nasymmetric reversals, a positive correlation of field strength and interval\nlength, and a bimodal field distribution. All these features are attributable\nto the magnetic field dynamics in the vicinity of an exceptional point of the\nspectrum of the non-selfadjoint dynamo operator. The negative slope of the\ngrowth rate curve between the nearby local maximum and the exceptional point\nmakes the system unstable and drives it to the exceptional point and beyond\ninto the oscillatory branch where the sign change happens. A weakness of this\nreversal model is the apparent necessity to fine-tune the magnetic Reynolds\nnumber and/or the radial profile of alpha. In the present paper, it is shown\nthat this fine-tuning is not necessary in the case of higher supercriticality\nof the dynamo. Numerical examples and physical arguments are compiled to show\nthat, with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, there is strong tendency for\nthe exceptional point and the associated local maximum to move close to the\nzero growth rate line. Although exemplified again by the spherically symmetric\nalpha^2 dynamo model, the main idea of this ''self-tuning'' mechanism of\nsaturated dynamos into a reversal-prone state seems well transferable to other\ndynamos. As a consequence, reversing dynamos might be much more typical and may\noccur much more frequently in nature than what could be expected from a purely\nkinematic perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2005 13:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Among the relevant topics let us mention\nentanglement and decoherence of macroscopic systems, together with applications\nto quantum memory for long distance quantum cryptography. Although the first\nexperimental demonstrations have been performed in atomic vapors and clouds,\nrare earth ion doped crystals are also interesting media for such processes. In\nthis paper we address Tm3+ ions capability to behave as three-level lambda\nsystems, a key ingredient to convert optical excitation into a spontaneous-\nemission-free spin wave. Indeed Tm3+ falls within reach of light sources that\ncan be stabilized easily to the required degree. In the absence of zero-field\nhyperfine structure we apply an external magnetic field to lift the nuclear\nspin degeneracy in Tm3+:YAG. We experimentally determine the gyromagnetic\ntensor components with the help of spectral hole-burning techniques. Then\nappropriate orientation of the applied field enables us to optimize the\ntransition probability ratio along the two legs of the lambda. The resulting\nthree-level lambda system should suit quantum information processing\nrequirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2005 14:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-14"}
