However, the computation of the optical properties of such\nparticles is still a very difficult problem. We analyze how the increase of\ngrain porosity influences basic features of cosmic dust -- interstellar\nextinction, dust temperature, infrared bands and millimeter opacity. Porous\ngrains can reproduce the flat extinction across the $3 - 8 \\mkm$ wavelength\nrange measured for several lines of sight by {\\it ISO} and {\\it Spitzer}.\n  Porous grains are generally cooler than compact grains. At the same time, the\ntemperature of very porous grains becomes slightly larger in the case of the\nEMT-Mie calculations in comparison with the results found from the\nlayered-sphere model. The layered-sphere model predicts a broadening of\ninfrared bands and a shift of the peak position to larger wavelengths as\nporosity grows.
