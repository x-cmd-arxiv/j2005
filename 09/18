In particular, we compute collisions of a 1.4\nMsun NS with realistically modelled parent stars of initial masses 0.8 and 0.9\nMsun, each at three different evolutionary stages (corresponding to three\ndifferent radii R). The distance of closest approach for the initial orbit\nvaries from 0.04 R (nearly head-on) to 1.3 R (grazing). These collisions lead\nto the formation of a tight binary, composed of the NS and the subgiant or\nred-giant core, embedded in an extremely diffuse common envelope (CE) typically\nof mass ~0.1 to 0.3 Msun. Our calculations follow the binary for many hundreds\nof orbits, ensuring that the orbital parameters we determine at the end of the\ncalculations are close to final. Some of the fluid initially in the envelope of\nthe (sub)giant, from 0.003 to 0.023 Msun in the cases we considered, is left\nbound to the NS. The eccentricities of the resulting binaries range from about\n0.2 for our most grazing collision to about 0.9 for the nearly head-on cases.\nIn almost all the cases we consider, gravitational radiation alone will cause\nsufficiently fast orbital decay to form a UCXB within a Hubble time, and often\non a much shorter timescale.
