We find agreement in detail but in\naddition we show that the isolated 1D system is self-similar and therefore\nunrelaxed. Fine graining of this system recovers much less prominent wave-like\nstructure than in a spherically symmetric isotropic 3D system. The rate of\ncentral flattening is also reduced in the 1D system. We take this to be\nevidence that relaxation of collisionless systems proceeds ultimately by way of\nshort wavelength Landau damping. N-body systems, both real and simulated, can\nbe trapped in an incompletely relaxed state because of a break in the cascade\nof energy to small scales. This may be due to the rapid dissipation of the\nsmall scale oscillations in an isolated system, to the existence of conserved\nquantities such as angular momentum, or to the failure in simulations to\nresolve sub-Jeans length scales. Such a partially relaxed state appears to be\nthe NFW state, and is to be expected especially in young systems. The NFW core\nis shown to be isolated. In non-isolated systems continuing coarse-grained\nrelaxation should be towards a density core in solid body rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2005 16:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We discuss\nseveral important properties of the emergent spectral energy distribution\n(SED): More near-infrared light (scattered and direct from the central source)\ncan escape than in smooth 1-D models. The near- and mid-infrared SED of the\nsame object can vary significantly with viewing angle, depending on the clump\ngeometry along the sightline. Even the wavelength-integrated flux can vary with\nangle by more than a factor of two.

Both MPCs and MRCs in\nelliptical galaxies formed from major mergers can exhibit significant rotation\nat large radii ($\\sim$20 kpc) due to the conversion of initial orbital angular\nmomentum into intrinsic angular momentum of the remnant. MPCs show higher\ncentral velocity dispersions than MRCs for most major merger models. $V_{\\rm\nm}/{\\sigma}_{0}$ (where $V_{\\rm m}$ and ${\\sigma}_{0}$, are the GCS maximum\nrotational velocity and central velocity dispersion of respectively) ranges\nfrom 0.2--1.0 and 0.1--0.9 for the MPCs and MRCs respectively, within $6R_{\\rm\ne}$ for the remnant elliptical.

We find that the most metal\nrich component, the anomalous Sub Giant Branch (SGB-a), has a metallicity of\n[Fe/H] -0.6 fully compatible with that determined along the anomalous Red Giant\nBranch (RGB-a). Our analysis suggests that the age of this component and of the\nother metal-intermediate (-1.4 < [Fe/H] < -1.0) stellar populations of the\nsystem are all comparable to that of the dominant metal poor population within\n2 Gyr regardless of any choice of helium abundance. These results impose severe\nconstraints on the time-scale of the enrichment process of this stellar system,\nexcluding the possibility of an extended star formation period. The radial\nvelocity analysis of the entire sample demonstrates that only the\nmetal-intermediate populations are kinematically cooler than the others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2005 14:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our mesoscopic approach overcomes the limitations of MD\nsimulations and can reach the small flow velocities of known experiments. We\nreproduce results from experiments at small Knudsen numbers and other\nsimulations, namely an increase of slip with increasing liquid-solid\ninteractions, the slip being independent of the flow velocity, and a decreasing\nslip with increasing bulk pressure. Within our model we develop a semi-analytic\napproximation of the dependence of the slip on the pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2005 15:49:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2006 07:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

From Alice, Bob, Charlie and Diana's Bell\nmeasurement results, Diana can infer the secret messages. If a perfect quantum\nchannel is used, the secret messages are faithfully transmitted from Alice, Bob\nand Charlie to Diana via initially shared pairs of four-particle GHZ states\nwithout revealing any information to a potential eavesdropper.
