The key problems are the\nquasar fuelling mechanism, the origin of the BH to bulge mass relation, the\ncausal and chronological link between BH growth and galaxy formation, the\nproperties of quasar hosts and the role of AGN feedback in galaxy formation.\nThis first paper has two goals: to describe the general structure and the\nassumptions of the method, and to apply AGNICS to studying the joint formation\nof BHs and spheroids in galaxy mergers. We investigate under what conditions\nthis scenario can reproduce the local BH distribution and the evolution of the\nquasar population. AGNICS contains two star formation modes: a quiescent one in\ndiscs and a starburst one in protospheroids, the latter triggered by mergers\nand disc instabilities. We assume that BH growth is linked to the starburst\nmode. The simplest version of this scenario, in which the BH accretion rate and\nthe star formation rate in the starburst component are simply related by a\nconstant of proportionality, does not to reproduce the cosmic evolution of the\nquasar population. A model in which this relation is modulated by a scaling\nwith the square root of the starburst gas density can explain the evolution of\nthe quasar luminosity function in B-band and X-rays (accounting for the\nobscuration inferred from X-ray studies). The scatter and the tilt that this\nmodel introduces in the BH-to-bulge mass relation are within the observational\nconstraints. The quasar contribution grows with bolometric luminosity and for a\ngiven bulge mass the most massive BHs are in the bulges with the oldest stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2005 19:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Furthermore, the non-variable\nobjects demonstrate the lack of any significant RV noise due to stellar\nactivity down to the precision necessary to detect giant planets. Thus, very\nyoung BDs and VLMSs are suitable targets for RV surveys for planets. Three\nobjects of the sample exhibit significant RV variations.

(2005) presented evidence for a sub-stellar,\ncommon proper motion companion to GQ Lup. With two theoretical mass estimates,\nboth below the Deuterium burning minimum mass limit, the companion is probably\na planet imaged directly. We present here a more detailed astrometric analysis\nof the GQ Lup system, using all the (different) proper motions published for\nthe primary. The common proper motion is significant in all cases, also when\ntaking into account the error in parallax or distance (140 +- 50 pc). When\nusing the weighted mean, the significance for common proper motion of GQ Lup\nand its companion is 7 + 4 sigma for no change in separation plus 8 sigma for\nno change in position angle. We also discuss the question, whether GQ Lup and\nits common-proper motion companion are not bound, but share the same or similar\nproper motion as two independent members of the Lupus T association, which is a\nmoving group, where most members should have the same motion anyway. Given our\ndiscussion, this hypothesis can be rejected by several sigma: The probability\nto find by chance an L-dwarf fainter than Ks = 14 mag within 0.7325 arcsec with\n(almost) the same proper motion of GQ Lup is only < 3 10^{-10}. The orbital\nmotion of the system is not yet detected (1.4 +- 2.2 mas/yr), but is probably\nsmaller than the escape velocity (5.3 +- 2.1 mas/yr), so that the system may\nwell be gravitationally bound and stable.

Starting the early 90's,\ncollaborations of economists and physicists produced increasingly realistic\nsimulation platforms. Currently, the market stylized facts are easily\nreproduced and one has now to address the realistic details of the Market\nMicrostructure and of the Traders Behaviour. This calls for new methods and\ntools capable of bridging smoothly between simulations and experiments in\neconomics.\n  We propose here the following Avatar-Based Method (ABM). The subjects\nimplement and maintain their Avatars (programs encoding their personal decision\nmaking procedures) on NatLab, a market simulation platform. Once these\nprocedures are fed in a computer edible format, they can be operationally used\nas such without the need for belabouring, interpreting or conceptualising them.\nThus ABM short-circuits the usual behavioural economics experiments that search\nfor the psychological mechanisms underlying the subjects behaviour. Finally,\nABM maintains a level of objectivity close to the classical behaviourism while\nextending its scope to subjects' decision making mechanisms.\n  We report on experiments where Avatars designed and maintained by humans from\ndifferent backgrounds (including real traders) compete in a continuous\ndouble-auction market. We hope this unbiased way of capturing the adaptive\nevolution of real subjects behaviour may lead to a new kind of behavioural\neconomics experiments with a high degree of reliability, analysability and\nreproducibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2005 17:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Unlike the standard scenario of PBH formation from string loops, in\nwhich the kinetic energy plays important role when strings collapse into black\nholes, the PBH formation may occur in our scenario after necklaces have\ndissipated their kinetic energy. Then, the significant difference appears in\nthe production ratio. In the standard scenario, the production ratio $f$\nbecomes a tiny fraction $f\\sim 10^{-20}$, however it becomes $f \\sim 1$ in our\ncase. On the other hand, the typical mass of the PBHs is much smaller than the\nstandard scenario, if they are produced in the same epoch.

Although the result obtained in this\npaper depends on the evolution of the dimensionless parameter $r$, the\nexistence of the winding state could be a serious problem in some cases. Since\nthe existence of the winding state in brane models is due to the existence of a\nnon-tivial circle in the compactified space, the PBH formation can be used to\nprobe the structure of the compactified space.
