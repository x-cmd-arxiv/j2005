Whole-Earth decompression is the consequence of Earth\nformation from within a Jupiter-like protoplanet with subsequent loss of gases\nand ices and concomitant rebounding.

The Procyon A simulation thus reveals two distinct timescales - the\nautocorrelation time of the vertical velocity and the characteristic timescale\nof the SAL which is tied to granulation. Just below the surface the\nautocorrelation decay time is about 5 minutes in Procyon A, and the SAL motion\ntimescale is 20-30 mins. When the SAL penetrates the optically thin region\nthere are efficient radiative losses and the peak of the SAL is low. We\nspeculate that these losses damp out the relative amplitudes in luminosity\n(temperature fluctuations) compared to velocity (Doppler). Although this will\nnot affect the frequencies of the peaks in the power spectrum, it will probably\nlower the average amplitude of the peaks relative to the noise background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2005 21:44:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A number of thermodynamic indicators such as\nspecific heat, caloric curve, root-mean-square bond length fluctuation,\ndeviation energy, etc. are calculated for each of the clusters. Size dependence\nof these indicators reveals several interesting features. The smallest clusters\nwith n= 8 and 10, do not show any signature of melting transition.

This formulation encompasses many of\nthe special cases studied in the literature and allows for capturing the common\nfeatures shared by them. Here, we focus on three special cases, namely 1) Relay\nChannel, 2) Multicast Channel, and 3) Conference Channel. These special cases\nare judicially chosen to reflect varying degrees of complexity while\nhighlighting the common ground shared by the different variants of the three\nnode wireless network. For the relay channel, we propose a new cooperation\nscheme that exploits the wireless feedback gain. This scheme combines the\nbenefits of decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward strategies and avoids\nthe idealistic feedback assumption adopted in earlier works. Our analysis of\nthe achievable rate of this scheme reveals the diminishing feedback gain at\nboth the low and high signal-to-noise ratio regimes. Inspired by the proposed\nfeedback strategy, we identify a greedy cooperation framework applicable to\nboth the multicast and conference channels. Our performance analysis reveals\nseveral nice properties of the proposed greedy approach and the central role of\ncooperative source-channel coding in exploiting the receiver side information\nin the wireless network setting. Our proofs for the cooperative multicast with\nside-information rely on novel nested and independent binning encoders along\nwith a list decoder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2005 02:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

This determines an off-shell closed\nsector of N=4 SuperYang-Mills, with 6 generators, which is big enough to fully\ndetermine the theory, in a Lorentz covariant way. This reduced algebra derives\nfrom horizontality conditions in four dimensions. The horizontality conditions\nonly depend on the geometry of the Yang-Mills fields.

In fact, the SL(2,R)\nsymmetry is induced by a dimensional reduction from eight to seven dimensions,\nwhich establishes a ghost-antighost symmetry, while the SU(2) symmetry occurs\nby dimensional reduction from seven to four dimensions.

We identify the C*-envelope of a subalgebra A of a\nC*-diagonal which contains D. For triangular subalgebras, each containing the\nMASA, a bounded isomorphism induces an algebraic isomorphism of the coordinate\nsystems which can be shown to be continuous in certain cases. For subalgebras,\neach containing the MASA, a bounded isomorphism that maps one MASA to the other\nMASA induces an isomorphism of the coordinate systems. We show that the weak\noperator closure of the image of a triangular algebra in an appropriate\nrepresentation is a CSL algebra and that bounded isomorphism of triangular\nalgebras extends to an isomorphism of these CSL algebras. We prove that for\ntriangular algebras in our context, any bounded isomorphism is completely\nbounded.

Our study is of very practical relevance, because it yields specific\npredictions of Undulator Radiation cross-spectral density in various parts of\nthe beamline. On the contrary, usual estimations of coherence properties assume\nthat the undulator source is quasi-homogeneous, like thermal sources, and rely\non the application of van Cittert-Zernike (VCZ) theorem, in its original or\ngeneralized form, for calculating transverse coherence length in the far-field\napproximation.
