It is essential in order to construct Triad operators\nthat enter the Hamiltonian constraint and which become densely defined\noperators on the full Hilbert space even though in the classical theory the\ntriad becomes singular when classical GR breaks down. The expression for the\nvolume and triad operators derives from the quantisation of the fundamental\nelectric flux operator of LQG by a complicated regularisation procedure. In\nfact, there are two inequivalent volume operators available in the literature\nand, moreover, both operators are unique only up to a finite, multiplicative\nconstant which should be viewed as a regularisation ambiguity. Now on the one\nhand, classical volumes and triads can be expressed directly in terms of fluxes\nand this fact was used to construct the corresponding volume and triad\noperators. On the other hand, fluxes can be expressed in terms of triads and\ntherefore one can also view the volume operator as fundamental and consider the\nflux operator as a derived operator. In this paper we examine whether the\nvolume, triad and flux quantisations are consistent with each other. The\nresults of this consistency analysis are rather surprising. Among other\nfindings we show: 1. The regularisation constant can be uniquely fixed. 2. One\nof the volume operators can be ruled out as inconsistent. 3.

During preheating, the energy in the homogeneous\ninflaton is exponentially rapidly transfered into highly occupied\nout-of-equilibrium inhomogeneous modes, which subsequently evolve towards\nequilibrium. The infrared modes excited during preheating evolve towards a\nsaturated distribution long before thermalization completes. We compute the\nequation of state during and immediately after preheating. It rapidly evolves\ntowards radiation domination long before the actual thermal equilibrium is\nestablished. The exact time of this transition is a non-monotonic function of\nthe coupling between the inflaton and the decay products, and it varies only\nvery weakly (around 10^(-35) s) as this coupling changes over several orders of\nmagnitude. This result is applied to refine the relation between the number of\nefoldings N and the physical wavelength of perturbations generated during\ninflation.

Ambainis, Mosca, Tapp and de Wolf in\nquant-ph/0003101 considered a more general setting, referred to as Private\nquantum channels, in which instead of classical information, quantum states are\nrequired to be transmitted and only one-way communication is allowed. They show\nthat in this case 2n bits of shared key is necessary and sufficient to transmit\nan n-qubit state. We consider the most general setting in which we allow for\nall possible combinations i.e. we let the input to be transmitted, the message\nsent and the shared resources to be classical/quantum. We develop a general\nframework by which we are able to show tight bounds on communication/shared\nresources in all of these cases and this includes the results of Shannon and\nAmbainis et al.\n  As a consequence of our arguments we also show that in a one-way oblivious\nRemote state preparation protocol for transferring an n-qubit pure state, the\nentropy of the communication must be 2n and the entanglement measure of the\nshared resource must be n. This generalizes on the result of Leung and Shor\nwhich shows same bound on the length of communication in the special case when\nthe shared resource is maximally entangled e.g. EPR pairs and hence settles an\nopen question asked in their paper regarding protocols without maximally\nentangled shared resource.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2005 19:35:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2005 19:20:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2005 21:57:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2006 08:22:17 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2006 00:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
