For this study we simulated the propagation of light jets with\ninternal Mach numbers 3 and 12 to lengths exceeding 100 initial jet radii in\nboth uniform and stratified atmospheres.\n  The propagating jets asymptotically deposit approximately half of their\nenergy flux as thermal energy in the ambient atmosphere, almost independent of\njet Mach number or the external density gradient. Nearly one-quarter of the jet\ntotal energy flux goes directly into dissipative heating of the ICM, supporting\narguments for effective feedback from AGNs to cluster media.

Despite having\ndifferent shock distributions and magnetic field features, global trends in\nenergy flow are similar among the different models.\n  As expected the jets advance more rapidly through stratified atmospheres than\nuniform environments. The asymptotic head velocity in King-type atmospheres\nshows little or no deceleration. This contrasts with jets in uniform media with\nheads that are slowed as they propagate.

The structure of the RG\nequations and the CKM matrix restrict the choices of the three input couplings\nto only eight possible combinations, each with its own distinctive experimental\nsignature. The relatively large input couplings may lead to spectacular low\nenergy signatures like rare weak decays of the $\\tau$ lepton and K mesons,\ndirect lepton number violating decays of several sparticles, and unconventional\ndecay modes (and reduced lifetime) of the lightest neutralino, assumed to be\nthe lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), all with sizable branching ratios.\nSeveral low background signals at the Tevatron and LHC have been suggested and\ntheir sizes are estimated to be at the observable level. From the particle\ncontent of the signal and the relative rate of different final states the input\ncouplings at the GUT scale, i.e., the origin of neutrino masses and mixing\nangles, can be identified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2005 11:08:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Interesting exact solutions that display several smooth bounces can\nthus be derived.

We formulate the Gel'fand-Dikii (GD) formalism on time scales by\nusing the delta differentiation operator and find more general integrable\nnonlinear evolutionary equations. In particular they yield integrable equations\nover integers (difference equations) and over $q$-numbers ($q$-difference\nequations). We formulate the GD formalism also in terms of shift operators for\nall regular-discrete time scales. We give a method to construct the recursion\noperators for integrable systems on time scales. Finally, we give a trace\nformula on time scales and then construct infinitely many conserved quantities\n(Casimirs) of the integrable systems on time scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2005 09:02:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2005 07:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show that the conservation-law\nbased constraints apply in a number of situations of experimental interest,\nsuch as Raman excitations, and atoms in free space interacting with the\nmultimode vacuum. We also show that for these systems, and for states with a\nsufficiently large photon number, the conservation-law based constraint\nrepresents an ultimate limit closely related to the fluctuations in the quantum\nfield phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2005 19:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The rate of the quantum\ndiffusion turns out to be less than the corresponding classical one, thus\nindicating the influence of quantum coherent effects. Another result is that\neven in the case when such a diffusion is possible, it terminates in time due\nto the mechanism similar to that of the dynamical localization.
