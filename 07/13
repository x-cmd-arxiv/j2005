Such symplectic integrators have been\nsuccessfully utilized for other Hamiltonian systems, e. g. for molecular\ndynamics or non-linear wave equations. Our procedure rests on a decomposition\nof the spin Hamiltonian into a sum of two completely integrable Hamiltonians\nand on the corresponding Lie-Trotter decomposition of the time evolution\noperator. In order to make this method widely applicable we provide a large\nclass of integrable spin systems whose time evolution consists of a sequence of\nrotations about fixed axes. We test the proposed symplectic integrator for\nsmall spin systems, including the model of a recently synthesized magnetic\nmolecule, and compare the results for variants of different order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2005 16:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Linear response calculations are carried out to examine\nthe phonon frequencies and electron-phonon coupling for various lattice\nparameters, and superconducting transition temperatures are obtained from the\nEliashberg equation. In both bct and fcc phases the superconducting transition\ntemperature T$_c$ is found to decrease with increasing pressure, due to\nstiffening of phonons with an accompanying decrease in electron-phonon\ncoupling. This is in contrast to a recent report, where T$_c$ is found to\nincrease with pressure. Even more drastic is the difference between the\nmeasured T$_c$, in the range 4-11 K, and the calculated values for both bct and\nfcc phases, in the range 60-100 K. The calculation reveals that the transition\nfrom the fcc to bct phase, as a result of increasing volume or decreasing\npressure, is caused by the softening of the X-point transverse phonons. This\nphonon softening also causes large electron-phonon coupling for high volumes in\nthe fcc phase, resulting in coupling constants in excess of 2.5 and T$_c$\nnearing 100 K.

The theoretical and experimental\nresearch in this thesis concentrates on the fundamental signal properties of\nDDF-based sequences in the presence of relaxation (T1 and T2) and diffusion. A\ngeneral introduction to magnetic resonance phenomenon is followed by a more in\ndepth introduction to the DDF and its effects. A novel analytical signal\nequation has been developed to describe the effects of T2 relaxation and\ndiffusing spatially modulated longitudinal spins during the signal build period\nof an HOMOGENIZED cross peak. Diffusion of the longitudinal spins results in a\nlengthening of the effective dipolar demagnetization time, delaying the\nre-phasing of coupled anti-phase states in the quantum picture.

For instance, in the case of projective measurements, it is possible to\nsolve this problem with protocols using one bit of communication or making one\nuse of a non-local box. We show that this problem reduces to a distributed\nsampling problem. We give a new method to obtain samples from a biased\ndistribution, starting with shared random variables following a uniform\ndistribution, and use it to build distributed sampling protocols. This approach\nallows us to derive, in a simpler and unified way, many existing protocols for\nprojective measurements, and extend them to positive operator value\nmeasurements. Moreover, this approach naturally leads to a local hidden\nvariable model for Werner states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2005 13:49:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
