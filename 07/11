The model is a concentric superposition of two components, each\nwith elliptical isophotes with constant flattening and position angle. The disk\nluminosity profile is assumed exponential, while the bulge is assumed to have a\nde Vaucouleurs or a Sersic profile. We find that the parameters returned by\nGim2D depend little on the waveband or bulge profile used; their formal\nuncertainties are usually small. Nevertheless, for bright galaxies the measured\ndistribution of b/a, the apparent disk flattening, deviates strongly from the\nexpected uniform distribution, showing that the `disk' identified by the code\nfrequently corresponds to an intrinsically 3-dimensional structure rather than\nto a true thin disk. We correct approximately for this systematic problem using\nthe observed statistics of the b/a distribution and estimate, as a function of\nabsolute magnitude, the mean fractions of galaxy light in disks and in `pure\nbulge' systems (those with no detectable disk). For the brightest galaxies the\ndisk light fraction is about 10% and about 80% are `pure bulge' systems. For\nfaint galaxies most of the light is in disks and we do not detect a `pure\nbulge' population. Averaging over the galaxy population as a whole, we find\nthat 54 \\pm 2% of the local cosmic luminosity density at both r and i comes\nfrom disks and 32 \\pm 2% from `pure bulge' systems. The remaining 14 \\pm 2%\ncomes from bulges in galaxies with detectable disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2005 11:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The\nmodel free energy combines mean-field electrostatic and phenomenological\nnon-electrostatic interactions, while the number of dissociated counterions is\ntreated as a variable degree of freedom that is determined self-consistently.\nThe model, therefore, joins two well-known theories: the Poisson-Boltzmann\ntheory for ionic solutions between charged lamellae, and\nLangmuir-Frumkin-Davies adsorption isotherm modified to account for charged\nadsorbing species. Minimizing the appropriate free energy for each\ninterlamellar spacing, we find the ionic density profiles and the resulting\nosmotic pressure. While in the simple Poisson-Boltzmann theory the osmotic\npressure isotherms are always smooth, we observe a discontinuous liquid-liquid\nphase transition when Poisson-Boltzmann theory is self-consistently augmented\nby Langmuir-Frumkin-Davies adsorption. This phase transition depends on the\narea per amphiphilic headgroup, as well as on non-electrostatic interactions of\nthe counterions with the lamellae, and interactions between counterion-bound\nand counterion-dissociated surfactants.
