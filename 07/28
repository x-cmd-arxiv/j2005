First, the lensing power is\nnon-zero only at intermediate redshifts between the observer and the source,\nkeeping record of the linear perturbation growth rate at the corresponding\nepoch.

We argue that the circumstellar absorption lines in early\nsupernova and in gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra may allow us to determine\nthe main properties of the Wolf-Rayet star progenitors which can produce those\ntwo events. To demonstrate this, we first simulate the hydrodynamic evolution\nof the circumstellar medium around a 40 Msun star up to the time of the\nsupernova explosion. Knowledge of density, temperature and radial velocity of\nthe circumstellar matter as function of space and time allows us to compute the\ncolumn density in the line of sight to the centre of the nebula, as a function\nof radial velocity, angle, and time. Our column density profiles indicate the\npossible number, strengths, widths and velocities of absorption line components\nin supernova and gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra.

Assuming that\nordinary matter scales canonically, we show that the continuity equation\nunivocally fixes the IR cutoff, provided a law of variation for either\nrho_Lambda or G_N is known. Previous considerations on holographic dark energy\ndisfavor the Hubble parameter as a candidate for the IR cutoff (for spatially\nflat universes), since in this case the ratio of dark energy to dark matter is\nnot allowed to vary, thus hindering a deceleration era of the universe for the\nredshifts z>=0.5. On the other hand, the future event horizon as a choice for\nthe IR cutoff is being favored in the literature, although the `coincidence\nproblem' usually cannot be addressed in that case. We extend considerations to\nspatially curved universes, and show that with the Hubble parameter as a choice\nfor the IR cutoff one always obtains a universe that never accelerates or a\nuniverse that accelerates all the time, thus making the transition from\ndeceleration to acceleration impossible. Next, we apply the IR cutoff\nconsistency procedure to a RG running CC model, in which the low-energy\nvariation of the CC is due to quantum effects of particle fields having masses\nnear the Planck scale. We show that bringing such a model in full accordance\nwith holography amounts to having such an IR cutoff which scales as a square\nroot of the Hubble parameter.

While query answering amounts to compute the result of a query\nover a database, query containment is the problem of checking whether for every\ndatabase, the result of one query is a subset of the result of another query.\n  In this paper, we deal with unions of conjunctive queries, and we address\nquery containment and query answering under Description Logic constraints.\nEvery such constraint is essentially an inclusion dependencies between concepts\nand relations, and their expressive power is due to the possibility of using\ncomplex expressions, e.g., intersection and difference of relations, special\nforms of quantification, regular expressions over binary relations, in the\nspecification of the dependencies. These types of constraints capture a great\nvariety of data models, including the relational, the entity-relationship, and\nthe object-oriented model, all extended with various forms of constraints, and\nalso the basic features of the ontology languages used in the context of the\nSemantic Web.\n  We present the following results on both query containment and query\nanswering. We provide a method for query containment under Description Logic\nconstraints, thus showing that the problem is decidable, and analyze its\ncomputational complexity. We prove that query containment is undecidable in the\ncase where we allow inequalities in the right-hand side query, even for very\nsimple constraints and queries. We show that query answering under Description\nLogic constraints can be reduced to query containment, and illustrate how such\na reduction provides upper bound results with respect to both combined and data\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2005 08:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The class of maneuverable wheeled systems is\ndefined consisting of systems that can follow any sufficiently smooth non-stop\ntrajectory on the plane. A sufficient condition for maneuverability is\nobtained. The design of control law that stabilizes motion along the desired\ntrajectory on the plane is performed in two steps. On the first step the\ntrajectory on the configuration manifold of the system and the input function\nare constructed that ensure the exact reproduction of the desired trajectory on\nthe plane. The second step is the stabilization of the constructed trajectory\non the configuration manifold of the system. For this purpose a recursive\nprocedure is used that is a version of backstepping algorithm meant for\nnon-stationary systems nonlinearly depending on input. The procedure results in\nthe continuous memoryless feedback that stabilizes the trajectory on the\nconfiguration manifold of the system.

The analysis is made for an eccentric sphere version of\nthe tippe top, assuming a modified Coulomb law for the sliding friction, which\nis a continuous function of the slip velocity $\\vec v_P$ at the point of\ncontact and vanishes at $\\vec v_P=0$. We study the relevance of the gyroscopic\nbalance condition (GBC), which was discovered to hold for a rapidly spinning\nhard-boiled egg by Moffatt and Shimomura, to the inversion phenomenon of the\ntippe top. We introduce a variable $\\xi$ so that $\\xi=0$ corresponds to the GBC\nand analyze the behavior of $\\xi$. Contrary to the case of the spinning egg,\nthe GBC for the tippe top is not fulfilled initially. But we find from\nsimulation that for those tippe tops which will turn over, the GBC will soon be\nsatisfied approximately. It is shown that the GBC and the geometry lead to the\nclassification of tippe tops into three groups: The tippe tops of Group I never\nflip over however large a spin they are given. Those of Group II show a\ncomplete inversion and the tippe tops of Group III tend to turn over up to a\ncertain inclination angle $\\theta_f$ such that $\\theta_f<\\pi$, when they are\nspun sufficiently rapidly. There exist three steady states for the spinning\nmotion of the tippe top. Giving a new criterion for stability, we examine the\nstability of these states in terms of the initial spin velocity $n_0$. And we\nobtain a critical value $n_c$ of the initial spin which is required for the\ntippe top of Group II to flip over up to the completely inverted position.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2005 09:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}
