By using a particle-in-cell simulation, we\ndemonstrate that the polarization electric fields are strongly enhanced in an\nexternally driven reconnection system, and some electrons can be trapped by the\nelectrostatic potential well of the polarization field. During the trapping\nphase, the electrons can gain their energies from the convection/inductive\nreconnection electric fields. We discuss that relativistic electrons with MeV\nenergies are quickly generated in and around the X-type neutral region by\nutilizing the surfing acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2005 02:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The anomalous symmetries of\nthe Standard Model (such as Peccei-Quinn or $B+L$) can be dualized to local\nsymmetries gauged by the Chern-Simons three-forms of the Standard Model gauge\ngroup. In this description the strong CP problem can be reformulated as the\nproblem of a massless three-form field in QCD, which creates an arbitrary\nCP-violating constant four-form electric field in the vacuum. Both the axion as\nwell as the massless quark solutions amount to simply Higgsing the three-form\ngauge field, hence screening the electric field in the vacuum. This language\ngives an alternative way for visualizing the physics of the axion solution as\nwell as the degree of its vulnerability due to gravitational corrections.

Their final goal would be to forecast\nfuture large earthquakes. In order to use them for this task, it is necessary\nto synchronize each model with the current status of the actual fault or fault\nnetwork it simulates (just as, for example, meteorologists synchronize their\nmodels with the atmosphere by incorporating current atmospheric data in them).\nHowever, lithospheric dynamics is largely unobservable: important parameters\ncannot (or can rarely) be measured in Nature. Earthquakes, though, provide\nindirect but measurable clues of the stress and strain status in the\nlithosphere, which should be helpful for the synchronization of the models. The\nrupture area is one of the measurable parameters of earthquakes. Here we\nexplore how it can be used to at least synchronize fault models between\nthemselves and forecast synthetic earthquakes. Our purpose here is to forecast\nsynthetic earthquakes in a simple but stochastic (random) fault model. By\nimposing the rupture area of the synthetic earthquakes of this model on other\nmodels, the latter become partially synchronized with the first one. We use\nthese partially synchronized models to successfully forecast most of the\nlargest earthquakes generated by the first model. This forecasting strategy\noutperforms others that only take into account the earthquake series. Our\nresults suggest that probably a good way to synchronize more detailed models\nwith real faults is to force them to reproduce the sequence of previous\nearthquake ruptures on the faults. This hypothesis could be tested in the\nfuture with more detailed models and actual seismic data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2005 16:28:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2006 19:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
