These\nsystems experience an active X-ray phase characterized by luminosities varying\nover a wide interval, from <10^36 erg/s up to a few 10^40 erg/s typical of the\nultra luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Roche lobe overflow on the zero-age main\nsequence and donor masses above 20 solar masses can maintain a long-lived\naccretion phase at the level required to feed a ULX source. In wide systems,\nwind transfer rates are magnified by the focusing action of the IMBH yielding\nwind luminosities around 10^38 erg/s. These high mass-IMBH binaries can be\nidentified as progenitors of IMBH-radio pulsar (PSR) binaries. We find that the\nformation of an IMBH-PSR binary does not necessarely require the transit\nthrough a ULX phase, but that a ULX can highlight a system that will evolve\ninto an IMBH-PSR, if the mass of the donor star is constrained to lie within 15\nto 30 solar masses. We show that binary evolution delivers the pre-exploding\nhelium core in an orbit such that after explosion, the neutron star has a very\nhigh probability to remain bound to the IMBH, at distances of 1-10 AU. The\ndetection of an IMBH-PSR binary in the Milky Way has suffered, so far, from the\nsame small number of statistics limit affecting the population of ULXs in our\nGalaxy. Ongoing deeper surveys or next generation radio telescopes like SKA\nwill have an improved chance to unveil such intriguing systems.

As a corollary we obtain that every simple weight module over the\nVirasoro algebra, having a non-trivial finite-dimensional weight space, is a\nHarish-Chandra module (and hence is either a simple highest or lowest weight\nmodule or a simple module from the intermediate series). This implies positive\nanswers to two conjectures about simple pointed and simple mixed modules over\nthe Virasoro algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2005 08:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-02"}
