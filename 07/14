MMSNRs show centrally filled thermal X-ray\nemission, which contrasts to shell-like radio morphology, a set of\nharacteristics at odds with the standard model of SNR evolution (e.g., the\nSedov model). We have therefore studied the evolution of the MMSNRs from the\nionization conditions inferred from the X-ray spectra, independent of X-ray\nmorphology. We find highly ionized plasmas approaching ionization equilibrium\nin all the mmsnrs. The degree of ionization is systematically higher than the\nplasma usually seen in shell-like SNRs. Radial temperature gradients are also\nobserved in five remnants, with cooler plasma toward the limb. In IC 443 and\nW49B, we find a plasma structure consistent with shell-like SNRs, suggesting\nthat at least some MMSNRs have experienced similar evolution to shell-like\nSNRs. In addition to the results above, we have discovered an ``overionized''\nionization state in W49B, in addition to that previously found in IC 443.\nThermal conduction can cause the hot interior plasma to become overionized by\nreducing the temperature and density gradients, leading to an interior density\nincrease and temperature decrease. Therefore, we suggest that the\n``center-filled'' X-ray morphology develops as the result of thermal\nconduction, and should arise in all SNRs. This is consistent with the results\nthat MMSNRs are near collisional ionization equilibrium since the conduction\ntimescale is roughly similar to the ionization timescale. Hence, we conclude\nthat MMSNRs are those that have evolved over$\\sim10^4$ yr.

The device consists of a pair of\nthin-film superconducting leads connected by a pair of topologically parallel\nultra-narrow superconducting wires. It exhibits intrinsic electrical\nresistance, due to thermally-activated dissipative fluctuations of the\nsuperconducting order parameter. Attention is given to the dependence of this\nresistance on the strength of an externally applied magnetic field aligned\nperpendicular to the leads, for lead dimensions such that there is essentially\ncomplete and uniform penetration of the leads by the magnetic field. This\nregime, in which at least one of the lead dimensions lies between the\nsuperconducting coherence and penetration lengths, is referred to as the\nmesoscopic regime. The magnetic field causes a pronounced oscillation of the\ndevice resistance, with a period not dominated by the Aharonov-Bohm effect\nthrough the area enclosed by the wires and the film edges but, rather, in terms\nof the geometry of the leads, in contrast to the well-known Little-Parks\nresistance of thin-walled superconducting cylinders. A theory, encompassing\nthis phenomenology, is developed through extensions, to the setting of parallel\nsuperconducting wires, of the Ivanchenko-Zil'berman-Ambegaokar-Halperin theory\nfor the case of short wires and the Langer-Ambegaokar-McCumber-Halperin theory\nfor the case of longer wires.

For the B=1 case we find the best localized wavefunction among\nlinear combinations of $j=1/2$ and $j=3/2$ angular momentum states. For B=2, we\nfind that the $j=1$ ground state has toroidal symmetry and a somewhat reduced\nlocalization compared to the classical solution. For B=4, where the classical\nSkyrmion has cubic symmetry, we construct cubically symmetric quantum states by\ncombining the $j=0$ ground state with the lowest rotationally excited $j=4$\nstate. We use the rational map approximation to compare the classical and\nquantum baryon densities in the B=2 and B=4 cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2005 14:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Recent experiments have revealed the\nmolecular correlate of gradient sensing: Frontness molecules, such as PI3P and\nRac, localize at the front end of the cell, and backness molecules, such as Rho\nand myosin II, accumulate at the back of the cell. Importantly, this\nfrontness-backness polarization occurs \"spontaneously\" even if the cells are\nexposed to uniform chemoattractant profiles. The spontaneous polarization\nsuggests that the gradient sensing machinery undergoes a Turing bifurcation.\nThis has led to several classical activator-inhibitor and activator-substrate\nmodels which identify the frontness molecules with the activator. Conspicuously\nabsent from these models is any accounting of the backness molecules. This\nstands in sharp contrast to experiments which show that the backness pathways\ninhibit the frontness pathways. Here, we formulate a model based on the\nmutually inhibitory interaction between the frontness and backness pathways.\nThe model builds upon the mutual inhibition model proposed by Bourne and\ncoworkers (Xu et al, Cell, 114, 201--214, 2003).
