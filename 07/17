By extending the analysis beyond the\nWKB approximation, we are able to study the non-linearities induced by a\ngravitational field. We treat the perturbed electromagnetic field as a fluid of\ninfinite conductivity. We calculate the scattering of a torsional (Alfven) wave\nby a gravitational potential, and demonstrate a nonlinear coupling with a\ncompressive (fast) wave which is second order in the amplitude of the Alfven\nwave. In a cylindrically symmetric spacetime with slow rotation, the coupling\nis second order in g_{t\\phi} and first order in the amplitude of the wave. We\nalso give a fresh analysis of the non-linear interactions between compressive\nand torsional waves in Minkowski space, with a focus on the relative strengths\nof their three- and four-mode interactions. In contrast with non-relativistic\nmagnetofluids, the effects of compression are always present. In the case of\ncolliding fast waves, a net displacement of the field lines across (at least)\none of the colliding wavepackets is shown to have a strong effect on the\noutgoing waveform, and to have a qualitatively different interpretation than\nwas previously suggested for colliding Alfven waves. Finally, we show how\nspacetime curvature modifies the collision between two torsional waves, in both\nthe weak- and strong-field regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2005 01:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We examine\nhow the sign property is transferred by the skew Robinson-Schensted\ncorrespondence invented by Sagan and Stanley. The result is a remarkably simple\ngeneralization of the ordinary non-skew formula. The sum of the signs of all\nstandard tableaux on a given skew shape is the sign-imbalance of that shape. We\ngeneralize previous results on the sign-imbalance of ordinary partition shapes\nto skew ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2005 19:11:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2006 12:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Customers of $I\\ge2$\nclasses can be served at these stations at different rates, that depend on both\nthe class and the station. A system administrator dynamically controls\nscheduling and routing. We study this model in the central limit theorem (or\nheavy traffic) regime proposed by Halfin and Whitt. We derive a diffusion model\non $\\mathbb {R}^I$ with a singular control term that describes the scaling\nlimit of the queueing model. The singular term may be used to constrain the\ndiffusion to lie in certain subsets of $\\mathbb {R}^I$ at all times $t>0$. We\nsay that the diffusion is null-controllable if it can be constrained to\n$\\mathbb {X}_-$, the minimal closed subset of $\\mathbb {R}^I$ containing all\nstates of the prelimit queueing model for which all queues are empty. We give\nsufficient conditions for null controllability of the diffusion. Under these\nconditions we also show that an analogous, asymptotic result holds for the\nqueueing model, by constructing control policies under which, for any given\n$0<\\epsilon <T<\\infty$, all queues in the system are kept empty on the time\ninterval $[\\epsilon, T]$, with probability approaching one. This introduces a\nnew, unusual heavy traffic ``behavior'': On one hand, the system is critically\nloaded, in the sense that an increase in any of the external arrival rates at\nthe ``fluid level'' results with an overloaded system. On the other hand, as\nfar as queue lengths are concerned, the system behaves as if it is underloaded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2005 09:47:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2005 06:34:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2007 09:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
