During our observations,\nGX 5-1 is mostly found in the horizontal and normal branch of its hardness\nintensity diagram. A clear hard X-ray emission is observed above ~30 keV which\nexceeds the exponential cut-off spectrum expected from lower energies. This\nspectral flattening may have the same origin of the hard components observed in\nother Z sources as it shares the property of being characteristic to the\nhorizontal branch. The hard excess is explained by introducing Compton\nup-scattering of soft photons from the neutron star surface due to a thin hot\nplasma expected in the boundary layer. The spectral changes of GX 5-1 downward\nalong the \"Z\" pattern in the hardness intensity diagram can be well described\nin terms of monotonical decrease of the neutron star surface temperature. This\nmay be a consequence of the gradual expansion of the boundary layer as the mass\naccretion rate increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2005 17:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The prediction is made\nwithout any assumptions about the microscopic theory responsible for WIMPs, and\ndepends only mildly on the unknown distribution of the total WIMP annihilation\ncross section among the possible final states. In particular, if the WIMPs\nannihilate into a pair of charged fermions (leptons or quarks), the photon\nspectrum possesses a sharp edge feature, dropping abruptly at a photon energy\nequal to the WIMP mass. If such a feature is observed, it would provide strong\nevidence for the WIMP-related nature of the flux enhancement, as well as a\nmeasurement of the WIMP mass. We discuss the prospects for observational\ndiscovery of this feature at ground-based and space-based gamma ray telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2005 17:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

While the standard approach to fluid\ndynamics, which is founded on the fluid approximation, is effective in\nproviding a means of calculating various behavior and properties, it begs the\nquestion of causality. The determination of the causes of many of the most\nimportant aerodynamic effects requires a microscopic examination of the fluid\nand of the surface with which it interacts. The Kutta-Joukowski theorem is\ninvestigated from first physical principles. It is noted that the circulation\ndoes not arise alone as a physical phenomenon, e.g. air doesn't flow forward\nunder a wing, but must be added to the translation flow. The circulation term\nis necessary to take into account the vertical deflection of the air flow by a\nwing.

The quantum-entangled particle interferometer\napproach is very general and applies to many types of interferometers. In\nparticular, without nonlocal entanglement, a generic classical interferometer\nhas a statistical-sampling shot-noise limited sensitivity that scales like\n$1/\\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of particles passing through the\ninterferometer per unit time. However, if carefully prepared quantum\ncorrelations are engineered between the particles, then the interferometer\nsensitivity improves by a factor of $\\sqrt{N}$ to scale like 1/N, which is the\nlimit imposed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
