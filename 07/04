The structure, consisting of\nseveral spiral arms, some almost completing a revolution about the center, is\nmost prominent within the radius of about 300 pc. Some filaments can be traced\nfurther out, where they seem to connect with the nuclear star-forming ring at\n0.7 kpc radius. Straight principal shocks running along the primary large-scale\nbar of NGC 1097, seen in the optical images as prominent dust lanes, curve into\nthis ring, but radio polarization vectors cross the nuclear ring under a rather\nlarge angle. Here we attempt to explain this morphology in terms of\nthree-dimensional gas flow in a barred galaxy. In our scenario, parts of the\nprincipal shock, which propagate in the off-plane gas, can cross the nuclear\nstar-forming ring, and excite waves inward from it. If the dispersion relation\nof the excited waves allows for their propagation, they will naturally take the\nshape of the observed central spiral. The nuclear region of NGC 1097 remains\nunresolved at sub-arcsec scales in the near-IR, with an upper size limit of <10\npc FWHM. Thus, any putative central dusty torus or gaseosus disk envisaged by\nthe AGN unified schemes has to be smaller than 10 pc in diameter at near-IR\nwavelengths. The extinction in the region between the nuclear star-forming ring\nand the nucleus increases very moderately, reaching A_v~1 at the immediate\nsurrounding of the nucleus. Thus, if the nuclear filaments are tracing cold\ndust, they contribute to a very low extinction in the line of sight and are\nlikely to be distributed in a rather thin disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2005 15:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Our calculated specific heat\ncurves have a main peak around 2300 K and 2200 K for Si$_{10}$ and Sn$_{10}$\nclusters respectively. However, various other melting indicators such as root\nmean square bond length fluctuations, mean square displacements show that\ndiffusive motion of atoms within the cluster begins around 650 K. The finite\ntemperature behavior of Si$_{10}$ and Sn$_{10}$ is dominated by isomerization\nand it is rather difficult to discern the temperature range for transition\nregion. On the other hand, Si$_{15}$ does show a liquid like behavior over a\nshort temperature range followed by the fragmentation observed around 1800 K.\nFinite temperature behavior of Si$_{20}$ and Sn$_{20}$ show that these clusters\ndo not melt but fragment around 1200 K and 650 K respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2005 11:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The time-dependent\nsignature of these sources in the detectors is a well-characterized function of\na relatively small number of parameters; thus, the favored analysis technique\nmakes use of matched filtering and maximum likelihood methods. Current analysis\nmethodology samples the matched filter output at parameter values chosen so\nthat the correlation between successive samples is 97% for which the filtered\noutput is closely correlated. Here we describe a straightforward and practical\nway of using interpolation to take advantage of the correlation between the\nmatched filter output associated with nearby points in the parameter space to\nsignificantly reduce the number of matched filter evaluations without\nsacrificing the efficiency with which real signals are recognized. Because the\ncomputational cost of the analysis is driven almost exclusively by the matched\nfilter evaluations, this translates directly into an increase in computational\nefficiency, which in turn, translates into an increase in the size of the\nparameter space that can be analyzed and, thus, the science that can be\naccomplished with the data. As a demonstration we compare the present \"dense\nsampling\" analysis methodology with our proposed \"interpolation\" methodology,\nrestricted to one dimension of the multi-dimensional analysis problem. We find\nthat the interpolated search reduces by 25% the number of filter evaluations\nrequired by the dense search with 97% correlation to achieve the same\nefficiency of detection for an expected false alarm probability.

The first part studies stock market data (chapter 1 to\n5). The second part is devoted to personal income in the USA (chapter 6).\n  We first study the probability distribution of stock returns at mesoscopic\ntime lags (return horizons) ranging from about an hour to about a month. For\nmesoscopic times the bulk of the distribution (more than 99% of the\nprobability) follows an exponential law. At longer times, the exponential law\ncontinuously evolves into Gaussian distribution.\n  After characterizing the stock returns at mesoscopic time lags, we study the\nsubordination hypothesis. The integrated volatility V_t constructed from the\nnumber of trades process can be used as a subordinator for a Brownian motion.\nThis subordination is able to describe approximatly 85% of the stock returns\nfor time lags that start at 1 hour but are shorter than one day. Finally, we\nshow that the CIR process describes well enough the empirical V_t process, such\nthat the corresponding Heston model is able to describe the log-returns x_t\nprocess, with approximately the maximum quality that the subordination allows.\n  Finally, we study the time evolution of the personal income distribution. We\nfind that the personal income distribution in the USA has a well-defined\ntwo-income-class structure. The majority of population (97-99%) belongs to the\nlower income class characterized by the exponential Boltzmann-Gibb(``thermal'')\ndistribution, whereas the higher income class (1-3% of population) has a Pareto\npower-law (``superthermal'') distribution.
