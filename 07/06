If the central engines of the huge\nenergy release are accreting relic black holes (BHs) of such mergers, it is\nimportant to understand how the properties of the BH-torus systems, in\nparticular disc masses and mass and rotation rate of the compact remnant, are\nlinked to the characterizing parameters of the NS binaries. For this purpose we\npresent relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations with\nconformally flat approximation of the Einstein field equations and a physical,\nnon-zero temperature equation of state. Thick disc formation is highlighted as\na dynamical process caused by angular momentum transfer through tidal torques\nduring the merging process of asymmetric systems or in the rapidly spinning\ntriaxial post-merger object. Our simulations support the possibility that the\nfirst well-localized short and hard GRBs 050509b, 050709, 050724, 050813 have\noriginated from NS merger events and are powered by neutrino-antineutrino\nannihilation around a relic BH-torus system. Using model parameters based on\nthis assumption, we show that the measured GRB energies and durations lead to\nestimates for the accreted masses and BH mass accretion rates which are\ncompatible with theoretical expectations. In particular, the low energy output\nand short duration of GRB 050509b set a very strict upper limit of less than\n100 ms for the time interval after the merging until the merger remnant has\ncollapsed to a BH, leaving an accretion torus with a small mass of only about\n0.01 solar masses. This favors a (nearly) symmetric NS+NS binary with a typical\nmass as progenitor system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2005 16:22:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2006 19:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This paper investigates four mechanisms that can affect the strength of\nthe WF effect that were not previously considered: (1) Photons redshifting into\nthe HI Lyman resonances may excite an H atom and result in a radiative cascade\nterminating in two-photon 2s->1s emission, rather than always degrading to\nLyman-alpha as usually assumed. (2) The fine structure of the Lyman-alpha\nresonance alters the photon frequency distribution and leads to a suppression\nof the scattering rate. (3) The spin-flip scatterings change the frequency of\nthe photon and cause the photon spectrum to relax not to the kinetic\ntemperature of the gas but to a temperature between the kinetic and spin\ntemperatures, effectively reducing the strength of the Wouthuysen-Field\ncoupling. (4) Near line centre, a photon can change its frequency by several\ntimes the line width in a single scattering event, thus potentially\ninvalidating the usual calculation of the Lyman-alpha spectral distortion based\non the diffusion approximation.

We consider both a\npseudospin ferromagnetic WC (FMWC) with IC and a pseudospin antiferromagnetic\nWC (AFMWC) without IC. Our central finding is that a FMWC can be pinned more\nstrongly due to the presence of IC. One specific mechanism is through the\ndisorder induced interlayer tunneling, which effectively manifests as an extra\npinning in a FMWC. We also construct a general \"effective disorder\" model and\neffective pinning Hamiltonian for the case of FMWC and AFMWC respectively.\nUnder this framework, pinning in the presence of IC involves\n\\textit{interlayer} spatial correlation of disorder in addition to intralayer\ncorrelation, leading to \\textit{enhanced} pinning in the FMWC. The pinning mode\nfrequency (\\wpk) of a FMWC is found to decease with the effective layer\nseparation, whereas for an AFMWC the opposite behavior is expected. An abrupt\ndrop of \\wpk is predicted at a transition from a FMWC to AFMWC.

In this area, a common top down\napproach is to model the fluid dynamics by Navier-Stokes equations and apply a\nnumerical techniques such as Finite Differences or Finite Elements for the\nsimulation. In this paper we focus on fluid modeling through Lattice Gas\nCellular Automata (LGCA) for computer graphics applications. LGCA are discrete\nmodels based on point particles that move on a lattice, according to suitable\nand simple rules in order to mimic a fully molecular dynamics. By\nChapman-Enskog expansion, a known multiscale technique in this area, it can be\ndemonstrated that the Navier-Stokes model can be reproduced by the LGCA\ntechnique. Thus, with LGCA we get a fluid model that does not require solution\nof complicated equations. Therefore, we combine the advantage of the low\ncomputational cost of LGCA and its ability to mimic the realistic fluid\ndynamics to develop a new animating framework for computer graphics\napplications.

The main theme of this paper is the\nstudy of linear q-difference equations over the field K of germs of meromorphic\nfunctions at 0. It turns out that a difference module M over K induces in a\nfunctorial way a vector bundle v(M) on the Tate curve $E_q:={\\mathbb\nC}^*/q^{\\mathbb Z}$. As a corollary one rediscovers Atiyah's classification of\nthe indecomposable vector bundles on the complex Tate curve. Linear\nq-difference equations are also studied in positive characteristic in order to\nderive Atiyah's results for elliptic curves for which the j-invariant is not\nalgebraic over ${\\mathbb F}_p$. A universal difference ring and a universal\nformal difference Galois group are introduced. Part of the difference Galois\ngroup has an interpretation as `Stokes matrices', the above moduli space is the\nalgebraic tool to compute it. It is possible to provide the vector bundle v(M)\non E_q, corresponding to a difference module M over K, with a connection\n$\\nabla_M$. If M is regular singular, then $\\nabla_M$ is essentially determined\nby the absense of singularities and `unit circle monodromy'.

A new approach is presented here, where\ninstead the notion of identity arrow is weakened -- these are tentatively\ncalled fair categories. The approach is simplicial in spirit, but the usual\nsimplicial category $\\Delta$ is replaced by a certain `fat' delta of `coloured\nordinals', where the degeneracy maps are only up to homotopy. The first part of\nthis exposition is aimed at a broad mathematical readership and contains also a\nbrief introduction to simplicial viewpoints on higher categories in general. It\nis explained how the definition of fair $n$-category is almost forced upon us\nby three standard ideas.\n  The second part states some basic results about fair categories, and give\nexamples. The category of fair 2-categories is shown to be equivalent to the\ncategory of bicategories with strict composition law. Fair 3-categories\ncorrespond to tricategories with strict composition laws. The main motivation\nfor the theory is Simpson's weak-unit conjecture according to which\n$n$-groupoids with strict composition laws and weak units should model all\nhomotopy $n$-types. A proof of a version of this conjecture in dimension 3 is\nannounced, obtained in joint work with A. Joyal. Technical details and a fuller\ntreatment of the applications will appear elsewhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2005 11:24:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2005 01:39:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2005 15:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-09"}

We show that, by careful design, one can attain\nwell defined modes close to the fundamental mode of optical fibers and obtain\nhigh coupling efficiencies also for bulk crystals, these being more easily\naligned than crystal waveguides. We distinguish between singles coupling,\nconditional coincidence, and pair coupling, and show how each of these\nparameters can be maximized by varying the focusing of the pump mode and the\nfiber-matched modes using standard optical elements. Specifically we analyze a\nperiodically poled KTP-crystal pumped by a 532 nm laser creating photon pairs\nat 810 nm and 1550 nm. Numerical calculations lead to coupling efficiencies\nabove 94% at optimal focusing, which is found by the geometrical relation L/z_R\nto be ~ 1 to 2 for the pump mode and ~ 2 to 3 for the fiber-modes, where L is\nthe crystal length and z_R is the Rayleigh-range of the mode-profile. These\nresults are independent on L. By showing that the single-mode bandwidth\ndecreases as 1/L, we can therefore design the source to produce and couple\nnarrow bandwidth photon pairs well into the fibers. Smaller bandwidth means\nboth less chromatic dispersion for long propagation distances in fibers, and\nthat telecom Bragg gratings can be utilized to compensate for broadened photon\npackets--a vital problem for time-multiplexed qubits.
