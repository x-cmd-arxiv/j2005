A thin outer layer of\nWolf-Rayet material is entrained by the jet head; it cools and becomes\nRayleigh-Taylor unstable, thereby providing an additional source of inertia and\nvariability. Pair creation in the wind material, and the associated\npre-acceleration, defines a characteristic radiative compactness at the point\nwhere the reverse shock has completed its passage back through the shell. We\nargue that the prompt gamma-ray emission is triggered by this external braking,\nat an optical depth ~1 to electron scattering. Torsional waves, excited by the\nforced reconnection of the reversing magnetic field, carry a fluctuating\ncurrent, and are damped at high frequencies by the electrostatic acceleration\nof electrons and positrons. We show that inverse Compton radiation by the\naccelerated charges is stronger than their synchrotron emission, and is beamed\nalong the magnetic field. Thermal radiation that is advected out from the base\nof the jet cools the particles. The observed relation between peak energy and\nisotropic luminosity is reproduced if the blackbody seeds are generated in a\nrelativistic jet core that is subject to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities with\nthe Wolf-Rayet envelope. This relation is predicted to soften to E_peak ~\nL_iso^{1/4} below an isotropic luminosity L_iso ~ 3x10^{50} ergs/s. The\nduration of spikes in the inverse-Compton emission is narrower at higher\nfrequencies, in agreement with the observed relation. The transition from\nprompt gamma-ray emission to afterglow can be explained by the termination of\nthe thermal X-ray seed and the onset of synchrotron-self-Compton emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2005 19:46:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2006 04:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In the IR/UV-UV color plane, the NGC5194 HII\nknots show the same trend observed for normal star-forming galaxies, having a\nmuch larger dispersion than starburst galaxies. We identify the dispersion as\ndue to the UV emission predominantly tracing the evolved, non-ionizing stellar\npopulation, up to ages 50-100 Myr. While in starbursts the UV light traces the\ncurrent SFR, in NGC5194 it traces a combination of current and recent-past SFR.\nUnlike the UV emission, the monochromatic 24 micron luminosity is an accurate\nlocal SFR tracer for the HII knots in NGC5194; this suggests that the 24 micron\nemission carriers are mainly heated by the young, ionizing stars. However,\npreliminary results show that the ratio of the 24 micron emission to the SFR\nvaries by a factor of a few from galaxy to galaxy. While also correlated with\nstar formation, the 8 micron emission is not directly proportional to the\nnumber of ionizing photons. This confirms earlier suggestions that the carriers\nof the 8 micron emission are heated by more than one mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2005 04:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The masing clouds are\nestimated to have a diameter of <0.7 pc and internal velocity dispersion of\nabout 20 km/s.

For an estimated internal density of 3 x\n10^3 cm^-3, cloud masses are of order 24 Msun.

The cloud mass outflow rate is estimated to be 0.8 Msun/yr, while\nthe star formation rate is about 19 Msun/yr.

It has been proposed that if this\nmatter, which is now being referred to as a {\\em strongly coupled Quark-Gluon\nPlasma} (sQGP), may behave as a liquid with a very small viscosity.\n  In this case, a very specific collective excitation should be produced,\ncalled the ``conical flow'', similar e.g. to the sonic booms generated by the\nshock waves produced by supersonic planes.

In this note we\nspeculate that for tagged heavy-quark jets one may observe a shrinkage of the\nMach cone at moderate $p_t$.

We present a scheme based on adiabatic\npassage that allows for transportation of a qubit, operator measurements and\nentanglement, using a 1-D array of quantum sites with a single sender (Alice)\nand multiple receivers (Bobs). Alice need not know which Bob is the receiver,\nand if several Bobs try to receive the signal, they obtain a superposition\nstate which can be used to realize two-qubit operator measurements for the\ngeneration of maximally entangled states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2005 08:50:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2005 02:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We next discuss Gleason's\ntheorem and Kochen-Specker theorem and bring out the troublems with non\ncontextual hidden variable theories. An important role is played by Einstein\nlocality in the discussion of hidden variable theories as was first brought out\nby Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen. We elaborate it's various implications such as\nBell's theorem in terms of Bell's inequalities as well as later work in which\nBell's theorem follows without using inequalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2005 10:21:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2005 06:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

New eigenstates emerge due\nto the nonlinearity, depending on the system parameters.

The Zener tunneling probability does not tend to zero in\nthe adiabatic limit and shows pronounced oscillations as a function of the\nvelocity of the parameter variation.
