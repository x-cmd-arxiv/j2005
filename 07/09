The two\ncomponents of the source faded with a power-law index of 1.1 +/- 0.1. We detect\nan upper limit to the proper motion of the Eastern component of ~3 x 10^3 km\ns^-1 relative to Sgr A*. We detect a proper motion of ~10^4 km s^-1 for the\nWestern component relative to Sgr A*. The transient was also detected at X-ray\nwavelengths with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the XMM-Newton telescope and\ngiven the designation CXOGC J174540.0-290031. The X-ray source falls in between\nthe two radio components. The maximum luminosity of the X-ray source is ~10^36\nerg s^-1, significantly sub-Eddington. The radio jet flux density predicted by\nthe X-ray/radio correlation for X-ray binaries is orders of magnitude less than\nthe measured flux density. We conclude that the radio transient is the result\nof a bipolar jet originating in a single impulsive event from the X-ray source\nand interacting with the dense interstellar medium of the Galactic Center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2005 20:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The expectation value of the radiative potential\ngives radiative corrections to the energies. Radiative corrections to E1\namplitudes can be expressed in terms of the radiative potential and its energy\nderivative (the low-energy theorem): the relative magnitude of the radiative\npotential contribution is ~alpha^3 Z^2 ln(1/(alpha^2 Z^2)), while the sum of\nother QED contributions is ~alpha^3 (Z_i+1)^2, where Z_i is the ion charge;\nthat is, for neutral atoms (Z_i=0) the radiative potential contribution exceeds\nother contributions ~Z^2 times. The advantage of the radiative potential method\nis that it is very simple and can be easily incorporated into many-body theory\napproaches: relativistic Hartree-Fock, configuration interaction, many-body\nperturbation theory, etc. As an application we have calculated the radiative\ncorrections to the energy levels and E1 amplitudes as well as their\ncontributions (-0.33% and 0.42%, respectively) to the parity non-conserving\n(PNC) 6s-7s amplitude in neutral cesium (Z=55).

In particular, host\npopulations interacting through a 'small-world' network of contacts support\nlower prevalence of infection than well-mixed populations, and the region in\nparameter space for which an invading strain can become endemic and coexist\nwith the circulating strain is smaller, reducing the potential to accommodate\npathogen diversity.
