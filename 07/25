We start with a root node\ncontaining all the particles and then recursively divide each node into two\nnodes each containing roughly equal number of particles,until each of the nodes\ncontains only one particle. The volume of such a leaf node provides an estimate\nof the local density. We implement an entropy-based node splitting criterion\nthat results in a significant improvement in the estimation of densities\ncompared to earlier work. The method is completely metric free and can be\napplied to arbitrary number of dimensions. We apply this method to determine\nthe phase space densities of dark matter halos obtained from cosmological\nN-body simulations. We find that contrary to earlier studies, the volume\ndistribution function $v(f)$ of phase space density $f$ does not have a\nconstant slope but rather a small hump at high phase space densities. We\ndemonstrate that a model in which a halo is made up by a superposition of\nHernquist spheres is not capable in explaining the shape of $v(f)$ vs $f$\nrelation, whereas a model which takes into account the contribution of the main\nhalo separately roughly reproduces the behavior as seen in simulations. The use\nof the presented method is not limited to calculation of phase space densities,\nbut can be used as a general-purpose data-mining tool and due to its speed and\naccuracy it is ideally suited for analysis of large multidimensional data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2005 19:47:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2008 23:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The goal is to determine the\ninfluence of initial metallicity and initial mass on the mass loss and\nevolution during the latest stages of stellar evolution. Dust-enshrouded giants\nare identified by their reddened near-IR colours and thermal-IR dust excess\nemission. Most of these objects are Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) carbon stars\nin intermediate-age clusters, with progenitor masses between 1.3 and about 5\nMsun.

All three spacecraft are on heliocentric and\nweakly eccentric orbits forming a stable triangle.

However, exact orbitography shows the so-called\n`breathing modes' of the arms where the arms slowly change their lengths over\nthe time-scale of a year. In this paper we analyse the breathing modes (the\nflexing of the arms) with the help of the geodesic deviation equations to\noctupole order which are shown to be equivalent to higher order\nClohessy-Wiltshire equations.

The equation of motion of any model of\nthis type is found to be a projection of the natural geodesic equation on a Lie\ngroup $G$ with Lie algebra ${\\cal G}$, and its phase space is interpreted as a\nHamiltonian reduction of an open submanifold of the cotangent bundle $T^*G$,\nusing the symmetry arising from the adjoint action of $G$ twisted by the\nunderlying automorphism. This shows the integrability of the resulting systems\nand gives an algorithm to solve them.

A general method for calculating response functions in the random\nphase approximation (RPA) with exchange is presented. The method is applicable\nfor finite-range nuclear interactions. Examples are shown in the case of\nsymmetric nuclear matter described by a Gogny interaction. It is found that the\nconvergence of the results with respect to the multipole truncation is quite\nfast. Various approximation schemes such as the Landau approximation, or the\nLandau approximation for the exchange terms only, are discussed in comparison\nwith the exact results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2005 08:23:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In order to bypass the square speedup\nlimitation of a standard quantum search algorithm it is necessary to develop\nother type of quantum search algorithms. It is described in detail in the paper\nfor a quantum dynamical method to solve the quantum search problems in the\ncyclic group state space. The binary dynamical representation for a quantum\nstate in the Hilbert space of the n-qubit quantum system is generalized to the\nmulti-base dynamical representation for a quantum state in the cyclic group\nstate space. Thus, any quantum state in the cyclic group state space may be\ndescribed completely in terms of a set of dynamical parameters that are closely\nrelated to the symmetric property and structure of the cyclic group.
