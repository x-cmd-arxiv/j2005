There has been recent disagreement between\nthe traditional idea that Be stars rotate between 50 and 80 percent of their\ncritical speeds and new ideas (inspired by the tendency for gravity darkening\nto mask rapid rotation at the equator) that their rotation may be very nearly\ncritical. This paper utilizes Monte Carlo forward modeling to simulate\ndistributions of the projected rotation speed (v sin i), taking into account\ngravity darkening, limb darkening, and observational uncertainties.

In combination with estimates of stellar radii these data allow us to\nconstruct distributions of surface angular momentum per unit mass at three\ndifferent epochs: nominally, 1, 2 and 50 My. Our main result is illustrated in\nFig. 18 and may be summarized as follows: (1) 50-60% of the stars on convective\ntracks in this mass range are released from any locking mechanism very early on\nand are free to conserve angular momentum throughout most of their PMS\nevolution, i.e. to spin up and account for the rapidly rotating young main\nsequence stars. (2) The other 40-50% lose substantial amounts of angular\nmomentum during the first few million years, and end up as slowly rotating main\nsequence stars. The duration of the rapid angular momentum loss phase is ~5-6\nMy, which is roughly consistent with the lifetimes of disks estimated from\ninfrared surveys of young clusters. The rapid rotators of Orion age lose less\nthan 10% of their (surface) specific angular momentum during the next 50 My\nwhile the slow rotators lose about two-thirds of theirs. A detectable part of\nthis loss occurs even during the ~1 My interval between the ONC and NGC 2264.\nThe data support the view that interaction between an accretion disk and star\nis the primary mechanism for evolving the broad, bimodal distribution of\nrotation rates seen for solar-like stars in the ONC into the even broader\ndistributions seen in the young MS clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2005 11:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We investigate how lifting the absolute neutrino mass\nscale by adding a type II see-saw contribution proportional to the unit matrix\ncan solve this problem. Generically, lifting the neutrino mass scale increases\nthe prediction for the mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino while the\ndecay asymmetry is enhanced and washout effects are reduced, relaxing the lower\nbound on the mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino from thermal\nleptogenesis. For instance in classes of unified theories where the lightest\nright-handed neutrino dominates the type I see-saw contribution, we find that\nthermal leptogenesis becomes possible if the neutrino mass scale is larger than\nabout 0.15 eV, making this scenario testable by neutrinoless double beta decay\nexperiments in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2005 16:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Here we present two new approaches to automatically filter the\nchanging configurations of spatial dynamical systems and extract coherent\nstructures. One, local sensitivity filtering, is a modification of the local\nLyapunov exponent approach suitable to cellular automata and other discrete\nspatial systems. The other, local statistical complexity filtering, calculates\nthe amount of information needed for optimal prediction of the system's\nbehavior in the vicinity of a given point. By examining the changing\nspatiotemporal distributions of these quantities, we can find the coherent\nstructures in a variety of pattern-forming cellular automata, without needing\nto guess or postulate the form of that structure. We apply both filters to\nelementary and cyclical cellular automata (ECA and CCA) and find that they\nreadily identify particles, domains and other more complicated structures. We\ncompare the results from ECA with earlier ones based upon the theory of formal\nlanguages, and the results from CCA with a more traditional approach based on\nan order parameter and free energy. While sensitivity and statistical\ncomplexity are equally adept at uncovering structure, they are based on\ndifferent system properties (dynamical and probabilistic, respectively), and\nprovide complementary information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2005 20:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}
