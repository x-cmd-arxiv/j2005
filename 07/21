This survey discovered three new binary systems, including one\nmarginally resolved pair with a projected separation of only 4.9 AU, resulting\nin an observed binary fraction of 25+/-14% at separations >4 AU. After\ncorrecting for detection biases assuming a uniform distribution of mass ratios\nfor q>0.6, the estimated binary fraction is 33+/-17%. The binary fraction is\nconsistent with that inferred for higher-mass stars in Upper Sco, but the\nseparation and mass ratio distributions appear to be different. All three\nlow-mass binary systems in Upper Sco are tight (<18 AU) and of similar mass\n(q>0.6), consistent with expectations based on previous multiplicity studies of\nbrown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the field and in open clusters. The\nimplication is that the distinct separation and mass ratio distributions of\nlow-mass systems are set in the formation process or at very young ages, rather\nthan by dynamical disruption of wide systems at ages >5 Myr. Finally, we\ncombine the survey detection limits with the models of Burrows et al.

Our results emerge in a study initially\nfocused on embedding certain information metrics over the two-level quantum\nsystems into a q-framework.
