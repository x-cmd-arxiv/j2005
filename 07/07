Here we present a thorough comparison\nbetween theoretical expectations of the galactic positron distribution within\nthe LDM scenario and observational data from INTEGRAL/SPI. Unlike previous\nanalyses, there is now enough statistical evidence to put tight constraints on\nthe shape of the dark matter halo of our galaxy, if the galactic positrons\noriginate from dark matter. For annihilating candidates, the best fit to the\nobserved 511 keV emission is provided by a radial density profile with inner\nlogarithmic slope gamma=1.03+-0.04. In contrast, decaying dark matter requires\na much steeper density profile, gamma>1.5, rather disfavoured by both\nobservations and numerical simulations. Within the annihilating LDM scenario, a\nvelocity-independent cross-section would be consistent with the observational\ndata while a cross-section purely proportional to v^2 can be rejected at a high\nconfidence level. Assuming the most simplistic model where the galactic\npositrons are produced as primaries, we show that the LDM candidate should be a\nscalar rather than a spin-1/2 particle and obtain a very stringent constraint\non the value of the positron production cross-section to explain the 511 keV\nemission. One consequence is that the value of the fine structure constant\nshould differ from that recommended in the CODATA. This is a very strong test\nfor the LDM scenario and an additional motivation in favour of experiments\nmeasuring alpha directly.

Without confirmation from\nEinstein's theory, however, it has been unclear whether we can rely on the\nanalysis, for example, near the horizon scale. In this work we will provide a\nconfirmation of using Newton's gravity in cosmology based on relativistic\nanalysis of weakly non-linear situations to the third order in perturbations.\nWe will show that, except for the gravitational wave contribution, the\nrelativistic zero-pressure fluid equations perturbed to the second order in a\nflat Friedmann background coincide exactly with the Newtonian results. We will\nalso present the pure relativistic correction terms appearing in the third\norder. The third-order correction terms show that these are the linear-order\ncurvature perturbation strength higher than the second-order\nrelativistic/Newtonian terms. Thus, the pure general relativistic corrections\nin the third order are independent of the horizon scale and are small in the\nlarge-scale due to the low-level temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation. Since we include the cosmological constant, our results\nare relevant to currently favoured cosmology. As we prove that the Newtonian\nhydrodynamic equations are valid in all cosmological scales to the second\norder, and that the third-order correction terms are small, our result has a\npractically important implication that one can now use the large-scale\nNewtonian numerical simulation more reliably as the simulation scale approaches\nand even goes beyond the horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2005 07:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The\nderived interactions in the spin-orbital model are strongly frustrated, with\nthe strongest orbital interactions selecting different orbitals for pairs of Ni\nions along the three different lattice directions.

An example is given\nby an atomic Sagnac interferometer, where for two ensembles propagating in\nopposite directions in the interferometer this phase difference encodes the\nangular velocity of the experimental setup. We discuss methods of squeezing\nseparately or jointly observables of the two atomic ensembles, and compare in\ndetail advantages and drawbacks of such schemes. In particular we show that the\nmethod of joint squeezing may improve the variance by up to a factor of 2. We\ntake into account fluctuations of the number of atoms in both the preparation\nand the measurement stage, and obtain bounds on the difference of the numbers\nof atoms in the two ensembles, as well as on the detection efficiency, which\nhave to be fulfilled in order to surpass the standard quantum limit. Under\nrealistic conditions, the performance of both schemes can be improved\nsignificantly by reading out the phase difference via a quantum non-demolition\n(QND) measurement. Finally, we discuss a scheme using macroscopically entangled\nensembles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2005 16:58:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2006 11:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
