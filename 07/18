The molecular gas is closely associated with the dust\nlane across the nucleus and its kinematic center is consistent with the mm\ncontinuum AGN. A comparison of our interferometric mosaic data, which fully\ncover the ~9kpc warped disk, with a previously obtained IRAM 30m single dish\nCO(1-0) map shows that the molecular gas distribution in the disk is heavily\nresolved by the PdBI map.

In the framework of a kinematic model using tilted rings, we\ninterpret the five symmetric source components as locations of strong orbital\ncrowding. We further find indications that the warp appears not only on kpc\nscales, but continues down to 250pc. Besides the sixth feature on the western\nside, the lower flux of the eastern components compared to the western ones\nindicates an intrinsic large scale asymmetry in NGC3718 that cannot be\nexplained by the warp.

In such a scenario, significant X-ray variability\nwould be expected due to the eccentricity of the orbit. The source has been\nobserved at X-rays by several missions, although with a poor coverage that\nprevents to reach any conclusion about orbital variability. Therefore, we\nconducted RossiXTE observations of the microquasar system LS 5039 covering a\nfull orbital period of 4 days. Individual observations are well fitted with an\nabsorbed power-law plus a Gaussian at 6.7 keV, to account for iron line\nemission that is probably a diffuse background feature. In addition, we have\ntaken into account that the continuum is also affected by significant diffuse\nbackground contamination. Our results show moderate power-law flux variations\non timescales of days, as well as the presence of miniflares on shorter\ntimescales. The new orbital ephemeris of the system recently obtained by\nCasares et al. have allowed us to show, for the first time, that an increase of\nemission is seen close to the periastron passage, as expected in an accretion\nscenario. Moreover, the detected orbital variability is a factor of ~4 smaller\nthan the one expected by using a simple wind accretion model, and we suggest\nthat an accretion disk around the compact object could be responsible for this\ndiscrepancy. On the other hand, significant changes in the photon index are\nalso observed clearly anti-correlated with the flux variations.

Its large\nmass makes the top quark an ideal laboratory to test predictions of\nperturbation theory concerning heavy quark production at hadron colliders. The\ntop quark is also a powerful probe for new phenomena beyond the Standard Model\nof particle physics. In addition, the top quark mass is a crucial parameter for\nscrutinizing the Standard Model in electroweak precision tests and for\npredicting the mass of the yet unobserved Higgs boson. Ten years after the\ndiscovery of the top quark at the Fermilab Tevatron top quark physics has\nentered an era where detailed measurements of top quark properties are\nundertaken. In this review article an introduction to the phenomenology of top\nquark production in hadron collisions is given, the lessons learned in Tevatron\nRun I are summarized, and first Run II results are discussed. A brief outlook\nto the possibilities of top quark research a the Large Hadron Collider,\ncurrently under construction at CERN, is included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2005 09:40:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2007 08:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Here we develop another approach to modeling\nheterogeneous populations by reducing the model to the Cauchy problem for a\nspecial system of ODEs. As a result, the total population size and current\ndistribution of the vector-parameter can be found in explicit analytical form\nor computed effectively. The developed approach is extended to the models of\ninhomogeneous communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2005 15:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
