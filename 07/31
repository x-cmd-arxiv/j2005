It is a wrong question. And, the truth angers certain referees who\nsomehow possess the ability to write lengthy rubbish referee reports and delay\ncertain papers indefinitely.\n  General relativity is a metric theory, particularly of Riemannian geometry,\nwhich is characterized by the existence of an inner product -- or, the\ninvariance of the proper time. According to Einstein field equations, a compact\nmass defines a spherical geometry around it and focuses photons from a distant\nsource to an observer with the source and observer as the two focal points.\nWhen the mass is spherically symmetric, the two dimensional lens equation that\nrelates the angular positions of a source and its images defines a point\ncaustic at the angular position of the lensing mass.\n  The third (radial) position of the point caustic is not defined. For an\narbitrary mass, the caustic extends into a web of piecewise smooth curves\npunctuated by cusps and again its notion exists only within the context of the\nlens equation. We point out a few errors in a couple of papers, published in\nthe Astrophysical Journal, which may be influential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2005 14:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
