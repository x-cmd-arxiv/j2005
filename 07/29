Here we perform numerical\nsimulations and find that for sufficiently magnetized sources, observed spectra\nabove 10^{19}eV approach again the case of pure proton injection due to\nincreased path-lengths and more efficient photo-disintegration of nuclei around\nthe sources. This decreases secondary fluxes at a given energy and thus\nrequires injection spectra ~E^{-2.6}, as steep as for pure proton injection.

This suggests that the harder ionizing photons are used up in the\nregions nearest the clusters, and the diffuse ionized gas farther out is\nphotoionized by 'leakage' of the leftover low-energy photons. The low values of\nthe [SII]/H-alpha line ratio, typically [SII]/H-alpha<0.4, indicates that the\nemission regions are photoionized rather than shock heated.

For the half-Heusler alloys\nNiMnSb and CoMnSb the dominant interaction is between the nearest Mn atoms. In\nthis case the MF and RPA estimations differ strongly. The RPA approach provides\nbetter agreement with experiment. The exchange interactions are more complex in\nthe case of full-Heusler alloys Co$_2$MnSi and Co$_2$CrAl where the dominant\neffects are the inter-sublattice interactions between the Mn(Cr) and Co atoms\nand between Co atoms at different sublattices. For these compounds we find that\nboth MF and RPA give very close values of the Curie temperature slightly\nunderestimating experimental quantities. We study the influence of the lattice\ncompression on the magnetic properties. The temperature dependence of the\nmagnetization is calculated using the RPA method within both quantum mechanical\nand classical approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2005 23:10:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2005 16:48:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Quantum effects mean that information need not be additive: a small\nnumber of quanta can lock a large amount of information, making it\ninaccessible.

It is\nan open question on how to characterize all frame sets for a given pair $(a,b)$\nin general. In the case that $a=2\\pi$ and $b=1$, a result due to Casazza and\nKalton shows that the condition that the set\n$F=\\bigcup_{j=1}^{k}([0,2\\pi)+2n_{j}\\pi)$ (where $\\{n_{1}<n_{2}<...<n_{k}\\}$\nare integers) is a Weyl-Heisenberg frame set for $(2\\pi,1)$ is equivalent to\nthe condition that the polynomial $f(z)=\\sum_{j=1}^{k}z^{n_{j}}$ does not have\nany unit roots in the complex plane. In this paper, we show that this result\ncan be generalized to a class of more general measurable sets (called basic\nsupport sets) and to set theoretical functions and continuous functions defined\non such sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2005 15:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The latter is a purely geometrical parameter\nwhich characterizes the deviation of local environment of a given nanosphere in\nan aggregate from spherical symmetry. Therefore, it is possible to predict the\nsites with anomalously large local fields in an aggregate without explicitly\nsolving the electromagnetic problem. We have also demonstrated that the average\n(over nanospheres) value of S does not depend noticeably on the fractal\ndimension D, except when D approaches the trivial limit D=3. In this case, as\none can expect, the average local environment becomes spherically symmetrical\nand S approaches zero. This corresponds to the well-known fact that in trivial\naggregates fluctuations of local electromagnetic fields are much weaker than in\nfractal aggregates. Thus, we find that, within the quasistatics, the\nlarge-scale geometry does not have a significant impact on local\nelectromagnetic responses in nanoaggregates in a wide range of fractal\ndimensions. However, this prediction is expected to be not correct in\naggregates which are sufficiently large for the intermediate- and\nradiation-zone interaction of individual nanospheres to become important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2005 17:25:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The protocol begins\nwith a third party (Charlie) encoding two lattice sites in unentangled states,\nand allowing unitary evolution under time. Alice and Bob perform a projective\nmeasurement on their respective qutrits at a given time, and obtain a\nmaximally-entangled Bell state with a certain probablility. We also consider\ntwo further protocols, one based on simple repetition and the other based on\nsuccessive measurements and conditional resetting, and show that the cumulative\nprobability of creating a Bell state between Alice and Bob tends to unity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2005 19:18:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2005 14:42:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2005 19:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
