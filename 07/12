They are particularly interesting because they\nprobe not only the galaxies themselves but also the ionization state of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM). The observed line strengths depend on the amount by\nwhich each photon is able to redshift away from line center before encountering\nneutral gas and hence on the size distribution of HII regions surrounding the\nsources. Here, we use an analytic model of that size distribution to study the\neffects of reionization on the luminosity function of Lyman-alpha emitters and\ntheir observed spatial distribution. Our model includes the clustering of\nhigh-redshift galaxies and thus contains ionized bubbles much larger than those\nexpected around isolated galaxies. As a result, Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies\nremain visible earlier in reionization: we expect the number counts to decline\nby only a factor ~2 (or 10) when the mean ionized fraction falls to x_i~0.75\n(or 0.5) in the simplest model. Moreover, the absorption is not uniform across\nthe sky: galaxies remain visible only if they sit inside large bubbles, which\nbecome increasingly rare as x_i decreases. Thus, the size distribution also\naffects the apparent clustering of Lyman-alpha selected galaxies. On large\nscales, it traces that of the large bubbles, which in our model are more biased\nthan the galaxies. On small scales, the clustering increases rapidly as x_i\ndecreases because large HII regions surround strong galaxy overdensities, so a\nsurvey automatically selects only those galaxies with neighbours.

The symmetry of the the \\bar{\\theta}\n-z relation is mirror-like, the mean polarization angle rotating clockwise with\nincreasing redshift in North Galactic hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the\nSouth Galactic one. These characteristics make the alignment effect difficult\nto explain in terms of local mechanisms, namely a contamination by interstellar\npolarization in our Galaxy. While interpretations like a global rotation of the\nUniverse can potentially explain the effect, the properties we observe\nqualitatively correspond to the dichroism and birefringence predicted by\nphoton-pseudoscalar oscillation within a magnetic field. Interestingly, the\nalignment effect seems to be prominent along an axis not far from preferred\ndirections tentatively identified in the CMB maps. Although many questions and\nmore particularly the interpretation of the effect remain open, alignments of\nquasar polarization vectors appear as a promising new way to probe the Universe\nand its dark components at extremely large scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2005 08:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is recalled that the Boltzmann's distribution is a\nsteady solution only when collisions are elastic; hence it is not applicable in\nthe case of dissipative granular gas. The first experimental case concerns\nnon-interacting balls in a vibrated cylindrical box, which proves that\nrotation-induced dissipation has important consequence: it reduces the\nefficient phase space dimension of this billiard-like system from 13-d to 1-d,\nsince the motion is 1d and quasi-periodic for large enough forcing; the result\nremains valid with 2 balls. The second experiment concern the dynamics of\ninteracting particles in the case of a small number (N= 12,24,36,48) of grains:\nThe typical speed of a balls is found to vary linearly with the piston speed,\nbut decreases when the number of balls N increases. The distribution of waiting\ntimes T1 between successive ball-gauge collisions follows an exponential\ndistribution experimentally, i.e. P(T1)= exp(-T1/To), proving uncorrelated\nmotions of balls. The amplitude I of the ball-gauge impacts is found to\ndecrease exponentially p(I)=exp(-I/Io).This is temptatively explained using a\nmodel \"a la Boltzmann\" associated with the notion of \"velostat\", and a second\nmodel is proposed based on dissipation.

Using the criterion, analysis made by involving a family\nof infinitesimally differed paths reveals that for attaining stationary action\nof the dynamic course it is necessary to involve orchestrated displacement of\nthe path family. Dynamics that generally follows from such analysis involves\nnonlocally mediated interaction besides the conventional ones. Amidst external\nfield perturbation it is shown that ubiquitous nonlocal mediation incessantly\nattempts optimizing displacement in accomplishing minimum radiation loss. The\nmediation involves virtual exchange of quantized energy and momentum of the\ninteracting field and particle, which in conformity with quantum mechanical\nprescription is describable by unitary evolution. Under increasingly high\nperturbation, the mediation can boost its defensive effort but up to a critical\nlimit with stress release predominantly as Larmor radiation relaxation.\nObservable acceleration and jerk, and relaxations thereof in the nonstationary\nevolution are indeed markers of the defense failure. Recoil from the Larmor\nrelaxation impedes kinetic energy growth and also imparts shear stress to the\nspherically polarized vacuum field of point charge; the transverse stress\nrelease having similitude of Hawking-Unruh radiation.

The set of mathematically consistent joint probability assignments\n(``states'') for such measurements is properly larger than the set of\nquantum-mechanical mixed states for the Alice-Bob system. It is canonically\nisomorphic to the set of positive (not necessarily completely positive) linear\nmaps Phi from the bounded linear operators on Alice's space to those on Bob's,\nfor which Tr Phi(I)=1. We review the fact that allowing classical communication\nis equivalent to enforcing ``no-instantaneous-signalling'' (``no--influence'')\nin the direction opposite the communication. We establish that in the subclass\nof ``decomposable'' states, i.e. convex combinations of positive states with\n\"PTP\" ones whose partial transpose is positive, the extremal states are just\nthe extremal positive and extremal PTP states. We show that two such states,\nshared by the same pair of parties, cannot necessarily be combined as\nindependent states (their tensor product) if the full set of quantum operations\nis allowed locally to each party. We use a framework of ``test spaces'' and\nstates on these, suited for exhibiting the analogies and deviations of\nempirical probabilistic theories from classical probability theory. This leads\nto a deeper understanding of analogies between quantum mechanics and Bayesian\nprobability theory. The existence of a ``most Bayesian'' quantum rule for\nupdating states after measurement, and its association with the situation when\ninformation on one system is gained by measuring another, is a case of a\ngeneral proposition holding for test spaces combined subject to the\nno-signalling requirement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2005 06:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In attempts to solve this problem,\nentanglement-based QKD, single-photon based QKD, and entanglement\nswapping-based QKD, have been studied in recent years. However, there are many\ntechnological difficulties that must be overcome before these schemes can\nbecome practical systems. Here we report a very simple QKD system, in which\nsecure keys were generated over >100 km fibre for the first time. We used an\nalternative protocol of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) but with a\nPoissonian source. We analysed the security of the DPSK protocol and showed\nthat it is robust even against hybrid attacks including collective PNS attack\nover consecutive pulses, intercept-and-resend (I-R) attack and beamsplitting\n(BS) attack, because of the non-deterministic collapse of a wavefunction in a\nquantum measurement. To implement this protocol, we developed a new detector\nfor the 1.5 um band based on frequency up-conversion in a periodically poled\nlithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide followed by a Si avalanche photodiode (APD).\nThe use of the new detectors increased the sifted key generation rate up to > 1\nMbit/s over 30 km fibre, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the\nprevious record.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2005 10:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Because time is treated similarly to the three space coordinates,\nrather than as an evolution parameter, such a spacetime approach has proved\nparticularly useful in the study of quantum gravity and cosmology.
