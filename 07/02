We have parametrized the\ncosmological temperature-redshift law as $T\\propto (1+z)^{(1-a)}$. Using two\nsets of SZ flux density ratios (100/143 GHz, which is most sensitive to the\nparametrization of the $T-z$ law, and 143/353 GHz, which is most sensitive to\nthe peculiar velocities of the clusters) we show that it is possible to recover\nthe $T-z$ law assuming that the temperatures and redshifts of the clusters are\nknown. From a simulated catalog of $\\sim 1200$ clusters, the parameter $a$ can\nbe recovered to an accuracy of 10$^{-2}$. Sensitive SZ observations thus appear\nas a potentially useful tool to test the standard law. Most cosmological models\npredict a linear variation of the CMB temperature with redshift. The discovery\nof an alternative law would have profound implications on the cosmological\nmodel, implying creation of energy in a manner that would still maintain the\nblack-body shape of the CMB spectrum at redshift zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2005 16:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The brightest source in the IC 10 field,\nX-1, shows a large variation by a factor of up to $\\sim 6$ on time scales\nduring the XMM-Newton observation.

During the 11 days following the burst, the AXP was observed further\nwith RXTE, XMM-Newton and Chandra. Pre- and post-burst observations revealed no\nchange in the total flux or spectrum of the quiescent emission. Comparing all\nthree bursts detected thus far from this source we find that this event was the\nmost fluent (>3.3x10^-8 erg/cm^2 in the 2-20 keV band), had the highest peak\nflux (59+/-9x10^-10 erg/s/cm^2 in the 2-20 keV band), and the longest duration\n(>699 s). The long duration of the burst differentiates it from Soft Gamma\nRepeater (SGR) bursts which have typical durations of ~0.1 s. Bursts that occur\npreferentially at pulse maximum, have fast-rises and long X-tails containing\nthe majority of the total burst energy have been seen uniquely from AXPs. The\nmarked differences between AXP and SGRs bursts may provide new clues to help\nunderstand the physical differences between these objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2005 03:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This paper is the second installment of a work scrutinizing\nthis effect with the use of algebraic methods in quantum theory. The general\nscheme worked out in the first part is applied here to the discussion of\nparticular models. We consider models of the quantum scalar field subject to\nexternal interaction with ``softened'' Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions\non two parallel planes. We show that the case of electromagnetic field with\nsoftened perfect conductor conditions on the planes may be reduced to the other\ntwo. The ``softening'' is implemented on the level of the dynamics, and is not\nimposed ad hoc, as is usual in most treatments, on the level of observables. We\ncalculate formulas for the backreaction energy in these models. We find that\nthe common belief that for electromagnetic field the backreaction force tends\nto the strict Casimir formula in the limit of ``removed cutoff'' is not\nconfirmed by our strict analysis. The formula is model dependent and the\nCasimir value is merely a term in the asymptotic expansion of the formula in\ninverse powers of the distance of the planes. Typical behaviour of the energy\nfor large separation of the plates in the class of models considered is a\nquadratic fall-of.
