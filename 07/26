Recently, extensive two\nand three dimensional simulations improved our understanding of the growth and\nsaturation of the instability in colliding plasma shells. However, the\nsteady-state structure of the shock wave transition layers remains poorly\nunderstood. We use basic physical considerations and order-of-magnitude\narguments to study the steady state structure in relativistic unmagnetized\ncollisionless shocks in pair plasmas. The shock contains an electrostatic layer\nresulting from the formation of stationary, magnetically-focused current\nfilaments. The filaments form where the cold upstream plasma and the\ncounterstreaming thermal plasma interpenetrate. The filaments are not entirely\nneutral and strong electrostatic fields are present. Most of the downstream\nparticles cannot cross this layer into the upstream because they are trapped by\nthe electrostatic field. We identify the critical location in the shock\ntransition layer where the electromagnetic field ceases to be static. At this\nlocation, the degree of charge separation in the filaments reaches a maximum\nvalue, the current inside the filaments comes close to the Alfv\\'en limit, and\nthe phase space distribution function starts to isotropize. We argue that the\nradius of the current filaments upstream of the critical location is about\ntwice the upstream plasma skin depth. Finally, we show that some downstream\nparticles cross the electrostatic layer and run ahead of the shock into the\npreshock medium without causing instability. These particles may play an\nimportant role in particle acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2005 19:17:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Unknown contributing factors can be eliminated\nthrough the evaluation of the amplitude ratios and phase differences arising\nfrom the brightness variation in different wavebands, theoretically enabling\nthe inference of the degree index from observations in two or more bandpasses.\nEmploying a designated model atmosphere code, we calculate the brightness\nvariation expected across the visible disk during a pulsation cycle in terms of\ntemperature, radius, and surface gravity perturbations to the emergent flux for\nrepresentative EC 14026 and PG 1716 star models.

We\ntook into account the misfit strain between film and substrate as well as\nsurface piezoelectric effect that causes built-in electric field in the\nstrained films. In the statistical theory framework we calculated random field\ndistribution function with the electric dipoles and monopoles as the field\nsources. It was shown that with thickness decrease the mean field decreases,\nwhile the width of the distribution function increases. This leads to the\nadditional smearing of the phase transition in the films in comparison to the\nbulk relaxors. As an example the dependence of the order parameter and\ndielectric susceptibility on the film thickness, temperature and random fields\ndistribution function parameters was obtained. For free standing film the\nexistence of critical thickness of relaxor state transformation into glassy\nstate was predicted. Contrary to this the appearance of misfit strain induced\nferroelectric phase appeared to be possible for some pairs film-substrate.

A unified treatment\nof these processes is outlined, based on factorization theorems of quantum\nchromodynamics, and using the correspondence between the \"parton\" picture in\nthe infinite-momentum frame and the \"dipole\" picture of high-energy processes\nin the target rest frame. The crucial role of the three-dimensional quark and\ngluon structure of the nucleon is emphasized. A new dynamical effect predicted\nat high energies is the unitarity, or black disk, limit (BDL) in the\ninteraction of small dipoles with hadronic matter, due to the increase of the\ngluon density at small x. This effect is marginally visible in diffractive DIS\nat HERA and will lead to the complete disappearance of Bjorken scaling at\nhigher energies. In hadron-hadron scattering at LHC energies and beyond (cosmic\nray physics), the BDL will be a standard feature of the dynamics, with\nimplications for (a) hadron production at forward and central rapidities in\ncentral proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions, in particular events with\nheavy particle production (Higgs), (b) proton-proton elastic scattering, (c)\nheavy-ion collisions.

Neuromodulation\ninfluences neural processing by presynaptic and postsynaptic regulation of\nsynaptic efficacy. Neuromodulation also affects ion channels and intrinsic\nexcitability. Methods: Synaptic efficacy modulation is an effective way to\nrapidly alter network density and topology. We alter network topology and\ndensity to measure the effect on spike synchronization. We also operate with\ndifferently parameterized neuron models which alter the neurons intrinsic\nexcitability, i.e., activation function. Results: We find that (a) fast\nsynaptic efficacy modulation influences the amount of correlated spiking in a\nnetwork. Also, (b) synchronization in a network influences the read-out of\nintrinsic properties. Highly synchronous input drives neurons, such that\ndifferences in intrinsic properties disappear, while asynchronous input lets\nintrinsic properties determine output behavior. Thus, altering network topology\ncan alter the balance between intrinsically vs. synaptically driven network\nactivity. Conclusion: We conclude that neuromodulation may allow a network to\nshift between a more synchronized transmission mode and a more asynchronous\nintrinsic read-out mode.

The existing non-Hermitian\nformalism breaks down when dealing with wavepackets(WP). An open question is\nhow time dependent expectation values can be calculated when the Hamiltonian is\nNH ? Using the F-product formalism, which was recently proposed, [J. Phys.\nChem., 107, 7181 (2003)] we calculate the time dependent expectation values of\ndifferent observable quantities for a simple well known study test case model\nHamiltonian. We carry out a comparison between these results with those\nobtained from conventional(i.e., Hermitian) quantum mechanics (QM)\ncalculations. The remarkable agreement between these results emphasizes the\nfact that in the NH-QM, unlike standard QM, there is no need to split the\nentire space into two regions; i.e., the interaction region and its\nsurrounding. Our results open a door for a type of WP propagation calculations\nwithin the NH-QM formalism that until now were impossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2005 07:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Larger samples allow to generate\nsuper-bunched light over a wide range of bath parameters and thus fluorescence\nlight intensities. We also identify parameter ranges where the fields emitted\non the two transitions are correlated or anti-correlated, such that the\nCauchy-Schwarz inequality is violated.
