For more evolved, carbon-rich, WR stars the wind\nstrength is also found to be dependent on the Fe abundance, so that they depend\non the chemical environment of the host galaxy, but with a mass loss\nmetallicity dependence that is less steep than for OB stars. Our finding that\nWR mass loss is Z-dependent is a new one, with important consequences for black\nhole formation and X-ray population studies in external galaxies.

Our revised estimate for the field\nstrength gives larger values than the classical estimate for flat radio spectra\nwith spectral indices of about 0.5-0.6, but smaller values for steep spectra\nand total fields stronger than about 10 muG. In very young supernova remnants,\nfor example, the classical estimate may be too large by up to 10x. On the other\nhand, if energy losses of cosmic ray electrons are important, K increases with\nparticle energy and the equipartition field may be underestimated\nsignificantly. Our revised larger equipartition estimates in galaxy clusters\nand radio lobes are consistent with independent estimates from Faraday rotation\nmeasures, while estimates from the ratio between radio synchrotron and X-ray\ninverse Compton intensities generally give much weaker fields.

Inorganic processes involving chiral products commonly yield\na racemic mixture of both. However life on Earth uses only one type of amino\nacids (L) and one type of natural sugars (D). The origin of this selective\nchirality has remained a fundamental enigma in the origin of life since the\ntime of Pasteur, some 140 years ago. Sodium bromate (NaBrO3) and sodium\nchlorate (NaClO3) when crystallize from an unstirred solution generates\nstatistically equal numbers of left-handed (L) and right handed (D) chiral\ncrystals. But when these two populations of crystals undergo a\ndissolution-crystallization phenomenon, they cannot coexist: one of them\ndisappears in an irreversible competition process that nurtures the other one.\n  From the viewpoint of energy, these two enantiomers can exist with an equal\nprobability, thus the result of this competition in different systems would be\npopulations of crystals either (L) or (D).

In order to describe the 2SC phase we use the three-flavour\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We explicitly take into account finite size effects\nby making use of the approximation for the density of states in spherical\ncavities called multiple reflection expansion (MRE). The thermodynamic\npotential for the 2SC strangelets is derived in the mean-field approximation\nwith the help of the MRE. We found that 2SC phase survives in small strangelets\nwith a sizable gap. Consequences for the 2SC phases are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2005 13:25:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2005 13:55:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2005 08:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We then use the\nWhitham modulation theory for a one-phase periodic travelling wave to obtain an\nasymptotic analytical description of an undular bore in the Su-Gardner system\nfor a full range of \"depth\" ratios across the bore.

The resolution\noffered in the literature, with help of quantum mixing entropy, was later shown\nto be unsatisfactory precisely where it sought to resolve the paradox.\nMacroscopic thermodynamics, classical or quantum, is unsuitable for explaining\nthe paradox, since it does not deal explicitly with the difference between the\ngases. The proper approach employs quantum thermodynamics, which deals with\nfinite quantum systems coupled to a large bath and a macroscopic work source.\nWithin quantum thermodynamics, entropy generally looses its dominant place and\nthe target of the paradox is naturally shifted to the decrease of the maximally\navailable work before and after mixing (mixing ergotropy). In contrast to\nentropy this is an unambiguous quantity. For almost identical gases the mixing\nergotropy continuously goes to zero, thus resolving the paradox. In this\napproach the concept of ``difference between the gases'' gets a clear\noperational meaning related to the possibilities of controlling the involved\nquantum states. Difficulties which prevent resolutions of the paradox in its\nentropic formulation do not arise here. The mixing ergotropy has several\ncounter-intuitive features. It can increase when less precise operations are\nallowed. In the quantum situation (in contrast to the classical one) the mixing\nergotropy can also increase when decreasing the degree of mixing between the\ngases, or when decreasing their distinguishability.
