As a possible solution for the paradox,\nwe speculate that the agent responsible for driving inflow to still smaller\nradii is transient and thus presently absent in the stellar potential.\nAlternatively, the gravity torque barrier associated with the ILR of the bars\nin these galaxies could be overcome by other mechanisms that become competitive\nin due time against gravity torques. We find that viscosity can counteract\nmoderate--to--low gravity torques on the gas if it acts on a nuclear ring of\nhigh gas surface density contrast and a few 100pc size.

A compact torus with a steep inner surface scatters more light\ntoward type-2 viewing angles than a large torus of the same half-opening angle,\ntheta0. For theta0 < 53 deg, the scattered light is polarized perpendicularly\nto the symmetry axis, whilst for theta0 > 60 deg it is polarized parallel to\nthe symmetry axis. In between these intervals the orientation of the\npolarization depends on the viewing angle. The degree of polarization ranges\nbetween 0% and 20% and is wavelength-independent for a large range of theta0.\nObserved wavelength-independent optical and near-UV polarization thus does not\nnecessarily imply electron scattering. For polar dust, scattering spectra are\nreddened for type-1 viewing angles, and made bluer for type-2 viewing angles.\nPolar electron-scattering cones are very efficient polarizers at type-2 viewing\nangles, whilst the polarized flux of the torus is weak.

This is a lower limit as we have ignored any increase of\ncircular velocity caused by baryonic dissipation. The massive-halo model\npredicts a median halo virial mass of 10^12.3 Msol, and a small spread of\ncircular velocities. Our median estimated dynamical mass is <10^(11.6+/-0.3)\nMsol, which is significantly smaller; furthermore, the spread of our circular\nvelocities is much larger than the massive-halo prediction.

Typically, such backgrounds arise as near-horizon\ngeometries of k coincident non-extremal NS5-branes, where 1/k measures\ncurvature of the backgrounds in string unit and hence size of string worldsheet\neffects. At classical level, string worldsheet effects are suppressed and\nD0-brane propagation in the Lorentzian black hole geometry is simply given by\nthe Wick rotation of D1-brane contour in the Euclidean black hole geometry.\nTaking account of string worldsheet effects, boundary state of the Lorentzian\nD0-brane is formally constructible via Wick rotation from that of the Euclidean\nD1-brane. However, the construction is subject to ambiguities in boundary\nconditions. We propose exact boundary states describing the D0-brane, and\nclarify physical interpretations of various boundary states constructed from\ndifferent boundary conditions. As it falls into the black hole, the D0-brane\nradiates off to the horizon and to the infinity. From the boundary states\nconstructed, we compute physical observables of such radiative process.

We also find that part of the radiation to horizon is\nin the Hagedorn distribution, dominated by massive, highly non-relativistic\nclosed string states, much like the tachyon matter. Remarkably, such\ndistribution emerges only after string worldsheet effects are taken exactly\ninto account.

The friction\nparameter $\"\\mu\"$ is also introduced to control the probability that the\nmovement of all agents involved to the same site (conflict) is denied at one\ntime step. This model displays two states; namely the freely moving and the\njamming state. If $\\mu$ is large and $p$ is low, the system is in the jamming\nstate even if the density is low.

Using\nthe ETAS branching model of triggered seismicity, we apply the formalism of\ngenerating probability functions to investigate how the statistical properties\nof observable earthquakes differ from the statistics of all events. The ETAS\n(epidemic-type aftershock sequence) model assumes that each earthquake can\ntrigger other earthquakes (``aftershocks''). An aftershock sequence results in\nthis model from the cascade of aftershocks of each past earthquake. The\ntriggering efficiency of earthquakes is assumed to vanish below a lower\nmagnitude limit $m_0$, in order to ensure the convergence of the theory and may\nreflect the physics of state-and-velocity frictional rupture. We show that, to\na good approximation, the ETAS model is renormalized onto itself under what\namounts to a decimation procedure $m_0 \\to m_d$, with just a renormalization of\nthe branching ratio from $n$ to an effective value $n(m_d)$. Our present\nanalysis thus confirms, for the full statistical properties, the results\nobtained previously by one of us and Werner, based solely on the average\nseismic rates (the first-order moment of the statistics).

The randomized stream cipher with randomization by quantum noise\nbased on Y-00 is called quantum stream cipher in this paper, and it may have\nsecurity against known plaintext attacks which has no analog with any\nconventional symmetric key ciphers. We present a simple cryptanalysis based on\nan attacker's heterodyne measurement and the quantum unambiguous measurement to\nmake clear the strength of Y-00 in real communication. In addition, we give a\ndesign for the implementation of an intensity modulation scheme and report the\nexperimental demonstration of 1 Gbps quantum stream cipher through 20 km long\ntransmission line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2005 05:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

It is pointed out that the standard nonrelativistic\nquantum theory, used by the authors in their analysis, cannot account for the\nresults found, and therefore that this experiment has fundamental importance\nbeyond the technical advances it represents. Some theoretical structures which\nconsider the time as an observable, and thus could, in principle, have the\nrequired coherence in time, are discussed briefly, and the application of\nFloquet theory and the manifestly covariant quantum theory of Stueckelberg are\ntreated in some detail. In particular, the latter is shown to account for the\nresults in a simple and consistent way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2005 07:38:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2005 07:30:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2005 06:59:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2005 12:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
