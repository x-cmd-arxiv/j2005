The arguments that support this conclusion are mainly based on\nperturbative approaches to the quantization, in which the gravitational\ninteractions of the matter content are described as corrections to a classical\nbackground. In a recent paper, we analyzed the existence of a minimum time\nuncertainty in the framework of doubly special relativity. In this framework,\nthe standard definition of the energy-momentum of particles is modified\nappealing to possible quantum gravitational effects, which are not necessarily\nperturbative. Demanding that this modification be completed into a canonical\ntransformation determines the implementation of doubly special relativity in\nposition space and leads to spacetime coordinates that depend on the\nenergy-momentum of the particle. In the present work, we extend our analysis to\nthe quantum length uncertainty. We show that, in generic cases, there actually\nexists a limit in the spatial resolution, both when the quantum evolution is\ndescribed in terms of the auxiliary time corresponding to the Minkowski\nbackground or in terms of the physical time. These two kinds of evolutions can\nbe understood as corresponding to perturbative and non-perturbative\ndescriptions, respectively. This result contrasts with that found for the time\nuncertainty, which can be made to vanish in all models with unbounded physical\nenergy if one adheres to a non-perturbative quantization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2005 11:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
