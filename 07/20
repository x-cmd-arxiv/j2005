We determine the locations of the blast wave (BW), contact\ndiscontinuity (CD), and reverse shock (RS) around the rim of Tycho's supernova\nremnant using a principal component analysis and other methods applied to new\nChandra data.

Taking account of\nprojection effects, we find ratios of 1:0.93:0.70 (BW:CD:RS). We show these\nvalues to be inconsistent with adiabatic hydrodynamical models of SNR\nevolution. The CD:BW ratio can be explained if cosmic ray acceleration of ions\nis occurring at the forward shock. The RS:BW ratio, as well as the strong Fe Ka\nemission from the Tycho ejecta, imply that the RS is not accelerating cosmic\nrays.

In its original formulation, the\nresulting numerical viscosity is large enough to suppress structure in the\nvelocity field on scales well above the nominal resolution limit, and to damp\nthe generation of turbulence by fluid instabilities. This could artificially\nsuppress random gas motions in the intracluster medium (ICM), which are driven\nby infalling structures during the hierarchical structure formation process. We\nshow that this is indeed the case by analysing results obtained with an SPH\nformulation where an individual, time-variable viscosity is used for each\nparticle (Monaghan 1997). Using test calculations involving strong shocks, we\ndemonstrate that this scheme captures shocks as well as the original\nformulation of SPH, but, in regions away from shocks, the numerical viscosity\nis much smaller. In a set of nine high-resolution simulations of cosmological\ngalaxy cluster formation, we find that this low--viscosity formulation of SPH\nproduces substantially higher levels of turbulent gas motions in the ICM,\nreaching a kinetic energy content in random gas motions (measured within a 1Mpc\ncube) of up to 5%-30% of the thermal energy content, depending on cluster mass.\nThis has also significant effects on radial gas profile. We find a central\nflattening of the entropy profile and a reduction of the central gas density in\nthe low--viscosity scheme. Interestingly, this tends to reduce the differences\nseen in SPH and adaptive mesh refinement simulations of cluster formation.\nFinally, invoking a model for particle acceleration by MHD waves driven by\nturbulence, we find efficient electron acceleration to power diffuse radio\nemission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2005 15:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
