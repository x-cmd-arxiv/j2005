Unlike previous studies, we use fully\nself-consistent 3D $N$-body simulations with live haloes, which are known to be\nimportant for bar evolution. The CMC is introduced gradually, to avoid\ntransients. In all cases where the mass of the CMC is of the order of, or more\nthan, a few per cent of the mass of the disc, the strength of the bar decreases\nnoticeably. The amount of this decrease depends strongly on the bar type. For\nthe same CMC, bars with exponential surface-density profile, which formed in a\ndisk-dominated galaxy (MD-type bars), can be totally destroyed, while strong\nbars with a flat surface-density profile, whose evolution is largely due to the\nhalo (MH-type bars), witness only a decrease of their strength. This decrease\noccurs simultaneously from both the innermost and outermost parts of the bar.\nThe CMC has a stronger effect on the Fourier components of higher azimuthal\nwave number $m$, leading to fatter and/or less rectangular bars. Furthermore,\nthe CMC changes the side-on outline from peanut-shaped to boxy or, for massive\nCMCs, to elliptical. Similarly, side-on initially boxy outlines can be\ndestroyed. The CMC also influences the velocity dispersion profiles. Most of\nthe decrease of the bar strength occurs while the mass of the CMC increases and\nit is accompanied by an increase of the pattern speed. In all our simulations,\nthe mass of the CMC necessary in order to destroy the bar is at least several\nper cent of the mass of the disc. This argues that observed super-massive black\nholes are not likely to destroy pre-existing bars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2005 15:20:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
