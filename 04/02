The spatial and\nvelocity structures of the intense group and the relative proper motions\nstrongly suggest that the maser emission is associated with a protostellar jet.\nComparing the observed LSR velocities with calculated radial velocities from a\nsimple biconical jet model, we conclude that the most of the maser emission are\nlikely to be associated with an accelerating biconical jet which has large\nopening angle. The large opening angle of the jet traced by the masers would\nsupport the hypothesis that poor jet collimation is an inherent property of\nluminous (proto)stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2005 23:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

By defining a low-energy Hubbard\nHamiltonian in the basis of Wannier functions for the t2g LDA band and solving\nit in the single-site DMFT approximation, it was recently shown[1] that\nsimultaneously with the Mott transition there occurs a strong suppression of\norbital fluctuations due to splitting of the t2g levels. The present paper\nreviews and expands this work, in particular in the direction of exposing the\nunderlying chemical mechanisms by means of ab initio LDA Wannier functions\ngenerated with the NMTO method. The Wannier functions for the t2g band exhibit\ncovalency between the transition-metal t2g, the large cation-d, and the\noxygen-p states; this covalency, which increases along the series, turns out to\nbe responsible not only for the splittings of the t2g levels, but also for\nnon-cubic perturbations of the hopping integrals, both of which are decisive\nfor the Mott transition. We find good agreement with the optical and\nphotoemission spectra, with the crystal-field splittings and orbital\npolarizations recently measured for the titanates, and with the metallization\nvolume for LaTiO3. The metallization volume for YTiO3 is predicted. Using\nsuper-exchange theory, we reproduce the observed magnetic orders in LaTiO3 and\nYTiO3, but the results are sensitive to detail, in particular for YTiO3 which,\nwithout the Jahn-Teller distortion, would be AFM C- or A-type, rather than FM.\nFinally, we show that it possible to unfold the orthorhombic t2g LDA\nbandstructure to a pseudocubic zone. In this zone, the lowest band is separated\nfrom the two others by a direct gap and has a width, W_I, which is\nsignificantly smaller than that, W, of the entire t2g band. The progressive\nGdFeO3-type distortion favours electron localization by decreasing W, by\nincreasing the splitting of the t2g levels and by decreasing W_I. Our\nconclusions concerning the roles of GdFeO3-type and JT distortions agree with\nthose of Mochizuki and Imada [2].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2005 19:45:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2005 14:45:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2005 13:01:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2005 14:44:39 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2005 12:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

In the diffusive limit with\nnegligible energy relaxation that shows two sharp steps at the Fermi energies\nof the two contacts, which are broadened due to the energy relaxation. In some\nof the experiments the broadening is reflecting an anomalous energy relaxation\nrate proportional to $E^{-2}$ instead of $E^{-3/2}$ valid for Coulomb\nelectron-electron interaction, where $E$ is the energy transfer. Later it has\nbeen suggested that such relaxation rate can be due to electron-electron\ninteraction mediated by Kondo impurities. In the present paper the latter is\nsystematically studied in the logarithmic approximation valid above the Kondo\ntemperature. In the case of large applied bias voltage Kondo resonances are\nformed at the steps of the distribution function and they are narrowed by\nincreasing the bias. An additional Korringa energy broadening occurs for the\nspins which smears the Kondo resonances, and the renormalized coupling can be\nreplaced by a smooth but essentially enhanced average coupling (factor of\n8-10). Thus the experimental data can be described by formulas without\nlogarithmic Kondo corrections, but with enhanced coupling. In certain regions\nof large bias, that averaged coupling depends weakly on the bias. In those\ncases the distribution function depends only on the ratio of the electron\nenergy and the bias, showing scaling behavior.

One of our important conclusions is that\neliminating RTS/CTS packets results in more effective operation under fading.\nWe also identify an unfairness problem that arises due to backoffs in the\npresence of fading. Moreover, fading results in several subtle interactions\nbetween the MAC and routing layers. We identify several of these problems and\nmake observations about effective approaches for addressing them. For example,\nthe criteria for determining the best path should not only consider the link\nstatus but also the link order. In addition, because routing protocols rely on\nMAC level transmission failure (when the retry limit is exceeded), route\nfailure errors are often generated unnecessarily. Finally, because MAC level\nbroadcasts are unreliable, they are especially vulnerable to fading.

Usually this is regarded as a\ndisadvantage. It results in a spread of arrival times, because each cube that\ncomprises the retroreflector is at a slightly different distance from the\nearth. However, we can turn this same effect into an advantage. Using pulses\nand detectors somewhat faster than those currently used for lunar ranging, we\ncan resolve at least some of the structure of a retroreflector, at least when\nthe libration angles are large. This additional structure in the transfer\nfunction means that a unique mm level fit can be obtained with many fewer\nphotons. Fitting to the expected reflector transfer function in general\nrequires fewer photons than straight averaging, and smoothly reduces to\naveraging in the cases where no structure can be resolved. The gains from\nresolving the reflectors are largest at large libration angles, exactly the\ncase where averaging is most inefficient. In these cases the number of photons\nneeded can be reduced by an order of magnitude or more. Analysis shows that\nangles for which the gain is very high happen several times each month, with\nthe details depending on the exact librations.
