Based on recent systematic searches it has\nbeen estimated that up to 10% of Kuiper-belt objects might be binaries.\nHowever, all examples discovered to-date are unusual, as compared to near-Earth\nand main-belt asteroid binaries, for their mass ratios of order unity and their\nlarge, eccentric orbits. In this article we propose a common dynamical origin\nfor these compositional and orbital properties based on four-body simulations\nin the Hill approximation. Our calculations suggest that binaries are produced\nthrough the following chain of events: initially, long-lived quasi-bound\nbinaries form by two bodies getting entangled in thin layers of dynamical chaos\nproduced by solar tides within the Hill sphere. Next, energy transfer through\ngravitational scattering with a low-mass intruder nudges the binary into a\nnearby non-chaotic, stable zone of phase space. Finally, the binary hardens\n(loses energy) through a series of relatively gentle gravitational scattering\nencounters with further intruders. This produces binary orbits that are well\nfitted by Kepler ellipses. Dynamically, the overall process is strongly favored\nif the original quasi-bound binary contains comparable masses. We propose a\nsimplified model of chaotic scattering to explain these results. Our findings\nsuggest that the observed preference for roughly equal mass ratio binaries is\nprobably a real effect; that is, it is not primarily due to an observational\nbias for widely separated, comparably bright objects. Nevertheless, we predict\nthat a sizeable population of very unequal mass Kuiper-belt binaries is likely\nawaiting discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2005 19:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the condition that small cosmological scale factor tend to\nlimit, the wave function of the universe can be obtained by applying the\nmethods developed by Vilenkin, Hartle and Hawking. Both Vilenkin's and\nHartle-Hawking's wave function predicts nonzero cosmological constant.

For that we introduce a new kind\nof competition among the individuals, using a modified Verhulst factor. The new\ncompetition depends on some specific phenotypic characteristic of each\nindividual, which is represented by a pair of bitstrings. These strings are\nread in parallel and have no age structure. In this way, each individual genome\nconsists of two parts. The first one has an age-structure and is related to the\nappearance of inherited diseases; the second part is not structured and takes\ninto account the competition for the available resources. We also introduce\nsexual selection into the model, making use of another non-structured and\nindependent pair of bitstrings.\n  In this thesis we present three different models; two of them use, besides\nthe competition, a sudden change in the ecology to obtain speciation. They were\nmotivated by the speciation process observed in the Darwin finches, a family of\nbirds that inhabits the Galapagos Islands, and also by that observed in the\ncichlids, a family of fish that lives in the Nicaragua Lakes and in the Vitoria\nLake, in Africa. The third model does not use any ecological change: sympatric\nspeciation is obtained depending only on the strength of competition among\nindividuals with similar phenotypic characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2005 12:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
