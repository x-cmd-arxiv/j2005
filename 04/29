A jet made of muons may play a key role in avoiding\nthe opacity of the SN-GRB radiation field. We propose a similar mechanism to\nexplain the emission of SGRs.

The Virtual Observatory concept is the\nastronomical community's response to these challenges: it aims to harness the\nprogress in information technology in the service of astronomy, and at the same\ntime provide a valuable testbed for information technology and applied computer\nscience. Challenges broadly fall into two categories: data handling (or \"data\nfarming\"), including issues such as archives, intelligent storage, databases,\ninteroperability, fast networks, etc., and data mining, data understanding, and\nknowledge discovery, which include issues such as automated clustering and\nclassification, multivariate correlation searches, pattern recognition,\nvisualization in highly hyperdimensional parameter spaces, etc., as well as\nvarious applications of machine learning in these contexts. Such techniques are\nforming a methodological foundation for science with massive and complex data\nsets in general, and are likely to have a much broather impact on the modern\nsociety, commerce, information economy, security, etc. There is a powerful\nemerging synergy between the computationally enabled science and the\nscience-driven computing, which will drive the progress in science,\nscholarship, and many other venues in the 21st century.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2005 23:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Particular attention is paid to clarifying how\nthe statistical properties of earthquakes depend on the frictional and elastic\nproperties of earthquake faults. It is found that, as the velocity-weakening\ntendency of the friction force gets weaker, the system tends to be more\ncritical, while, as the velocity-weakening tendency gets stronger, the system\ntends to be more off-critical with enhanced features of a characteristic\nearthquake. The model exhibits several eminent precursory phenomena prior to\nthe large event in its spatio-temporal correlations. Preceding the mainshock,\nthe frequency of smaller events is gradually enhanced, whereas, just before the\nmainshock, it is suppressed in a close vicinity of the epicenter of the\nupcoming event (the Mogi doughnut). The time scale of the onset of the\ndoughnut-like quiescence depends on the extent of the frictional instability.\nUnder certain conditions, preceding the mainshock, the apparent B-value of the\nmagnitude distribution increases significantly. The existence of such distinct\nprecursory phenomena may open a way to the prediction of the time and the\nposition of the upcoming large event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2005 03:08:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2006 02:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
