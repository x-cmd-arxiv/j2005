We describe a new, non-parametric\nanalysis of the kinematics of nearby dSph galaxies designed to take full\nadvantage of the future large datasets. The method takes as input the projected\npositions and radial velocities of stars known to be members of the galaxies,\nbut does not use any parametric dynamical model, nor the assumption that the\nmass distribution follows that of the visible matter. The problem of estimating\nthe radial mass distribution, M(r) (the mass interior to true radius r), is\nconverted into a problem of estimating a regression function\nnon-parametrically. From the Jeans Equation we show that the unknown regression\nfunction is subject to fundamental shape restrictions which we exploit in our\nanalysis using statistical techniques borrowed from isotonic estimation and\nspline smoothing. Simulations indicate that M(r) can be estimated to within a\nfactor of two or better with samples as small as 1000 stars over almost the\nentire radial range sampled by the kinematic data. The technique is applied to\na sample of 181 stars in the Fornax dSph galaxy.

A significant\nupturn in the low temperature total heat capacity over $T$ ratio is attributed\nto the electron hopping which largely contributes to the action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2005 16:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Using a semiclassical description for\nthe atom and field dynamics, we derive a closed system of differential\nequations to describe this coupled atom-field dynamics. For sufficiently strong\npumping the system starts lasing when the atom gets close to a field antinode,\nand the associated light forces provide for self-trapping of the atom. For a\ncavity mode blue detuned with respect to the atomic transition frequency this\nis combined with cavity induced motional cooling allowing for long term\nsteady-state operation of such a laser. The analytical results for temperature\nand field statistics agree well with our earlier predictions based on Quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations. We find sub-Doppler temperatures that decrease with\ngain and coupling strength and can even go beyond the limit of passive cavity\ncooling. Besides demonstrating the importance of light forces in single-atom\nlasers, this result also gives strong evidence to enhance laser cooling through\nstimulated emission in resonators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2005 15:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-18"}
