The structure of the galaxy\nmodels and the orbital configurations are chosen in accordance to those\nexpected in a LCDM Universe.While tidal stirring of disky dwarfs produces\nobjects whose stellar structure and kinematics resembles that of dwarf\nspheroidals after a few orbits, ram pressure stripping is needed to entirely\nremove their gas component. Gravitational tides can aid ram pressure stripping\nby diminishing the overall potential of the dwarf, but tides also induce bar\nformation which funnels gas inwards making subsequent stripping more difficult.\nThis inflow is particularly effective when the gas can cool radiatively.\nAssuming a low density of the hot Galactic corona consistent with observational\nconstraints, dwarfs with V_{peak} < 30 km/s can be completely stripped of their\ngas content on orbits with pericenters of 50 kpc or less. Instead, dwarfs with\nmore massive dark haloes and V_{peak} > 30 km/s lose most or all of their gas\ncontent only if a heating source keeps the gas extended, partially\ncounteracting the bar-driven inflow. We show that the ionizing radiation from\nthe cosmic UV background at z > 2 can provide the required heating. In these\nobjects most of the gas is removed or becomes ionized at the first pericenter\npassage,explaining the early truncation of the star formation observed in Draco\nand Ursa Minor.

The relative intensity from\nthe different ionization stages of iron is sensitive to the density of the\nemitting iron-rich material.

While the first one develops mostly in the inner\nregions of the star, the second one is favored in the outer regions, where the\nRossby number is much smaller and a mean-field dynamo action is more efficient.\nBy solving the mean-field induction equation we have computed the critical spin\nperiod below which no dynamo action is possible and found it to be $\\sim 1$ s\nfor a wide range of stellar models and for both axisymmetric and\nnon-axisymmetric magnetic fields. Because this critical period is substantially\nlonger than the characteristic spin period of very young pulsars, we expect\nthat a mean-field dynamo will be effective for most protoneutron stars. The\nsaturation dipole field estimated by making use of the model of ``global''\nquenching fits well the pulsar magnetic fields inferred from the spin-down\ndata. Apart from the large scale magnetic field, our model predicts also a\ngeneration of small scale fields which are typically stronger than the poloidal\nfield and can survive during the lifetime of pulsars. Extremely rapidly\nrotating protoneutron stars ($P \\sim 1$ ms) may have the dipole field $\\sim\n(3-6) \\times 10^{14}$ G.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2005 14:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Experiments at the Tevatron ppbar Collider and at the CERN Large\nHadron Collider (LHC) must be able to discover a Standard Model Higgs boson\nover the full mass range as well as Higgs bosons in extended models. In this\nreview, the discovery potential for the Standard Model Higgs boson and for\nHiggs bosons in the Minimal Supersymmetric extension is summarized. Emphasis is\nput on those studies which have been performed recently within the experimental\ncollaborations using a realistic simulation of the detector performance. This\nincludes a discussion of the search for Higgs bosons using the vector boson\nfusion mode at the LHC, a discussion on the measurement of Higgs boson\nparameters as well as a detailed review of the MSSM sector for different\nbenchmark scenarios. The Tevatron part of the review also contains a discussion\nof first physics results from data taken in the ongoing Run II.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2005 16:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In the present note, we consider the action of the affine\nWeyl group, or more precisely, the recurrences satisfied by special cases of\nthe integral. These are of two flavors: linear recurrences that hold only up to\ndimension 6, and three families of bilinear recurrences that hold in arbitrary\ndimension, subject to a condition on the parameters. As a corollary, we find\nthat a codimension one special case of the integral is a tau function for the\nelliptic Painlev\\'e equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2005 23:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
