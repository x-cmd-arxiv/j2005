The\nstudy of the phenomena associated with the chiral phase transition will give us\nsome clues on the connection between the chiral symmetry and the low-energy\nhadron dynamics.\n  We develop the theory based on the hidden local symmetry (HLS) at finite\ntemperature, which is an effective field theory of QCD and includes pions and\nvector mesons as the dynamical degrees of freedom, and study the chiral phase\ntransition in hot matter. We show that the chiral symmetry is restored as the\nvector manifestation (VM), in which the massless degenerate pion (and its\nflavor partners) and the longitudinal $\\rho$ meson (and its flavor partners) as\nthe chiral partner.

In the first part of the book \"Quantum electrodynamics\"\nwe follow rather traditional approach to particle physics. Our discussion\nproceeds systematically from the principle of relativity and postulates of\nquantum measurements to the renormalization in quantum electrodynamics. In the\nsecond part of the book \"Quantum theory of particles\" this traditional approach\nis reexamined. We find that formulas of special relativity should be modified\nto take into account particle interactions. We also suggest reinterpreting\nquantum field theory in the language of physical \"dressed\" particles. This\nformulation eliminates the need for renormalization and opens up a new way for\nstudying dynamical and bound state properties of quantum interacting systems.\nThe developed theory is applied to realistic physical objects and processes\nincluding the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom, the decay law of moving\nunstable particles, and the electric field of relativistic electron beams.\nThese results force us to take a fresh look at some core issues of modern\nparticle theories, in particular, the Minkowski space-time unification, the\nrole of quantum fields and renormalization as well as the alleged impossibility\nof action-at-a-distance. A new perspective on these issues is suggested. It can\nhelp to solve the old problem of theoretical physics -- a consistent\nunification of relativity and quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2005 18:22:32 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2008 21:44:50 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2009 21:32:41 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2009 22:34:50 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2010 22:34:26 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2011 22:31:23 GMT"},{"version":"v15","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2012 02:36:33 GMT"},{"version":"v16","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2013 05:41:59 GMT"},{"version":"v17","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 05:28:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2005 01:05:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2006 19:38:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2006 20:32:46 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2006 17:20:36 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2007 00:01:24 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 18 Nov 2007 03:31:04 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 1 May 2008 01:17:39 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2008 20:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

In the Petz-Sudar work\n(completing a program of Chentsov), the quantum analogue of the (classically\nunique) Fisher information (montone) metric of a probability simplex was\nextended to define an uncountable infinitude of Riemannian (also monotone)\nmetrics on the set of positive definite density matrices.
