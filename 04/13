Multi-frequency arcminute-resolution SZ observations can,\nin principle, determine each cluster's gas temperature (T_e), bulk velocity\n(v_pec), and optical depth (tau). However, the frequency bands and detector\nsensitivity employed by upcoming surveys will generally not be sufficient to\ndisentangle the degeneracy between these three cluster parameters, even in the\nabsence of SZ signal contamination from point sources and imperfect primary\nmicrowave background subtraction. Assuming contaminants can be removed, we find\nthat near-future SZ surveys will be able to constrain well two cluster gas\nparameters that are linear combinations of tau*T_e, tau*v_z, and tau*T_e^2.\nBecause the SZ intensity shift is nearly a linear function of tau*T_e, tau*v_z,\nand tau*T_e^2, a correspondence exists between the two effective gas parameters\nthat SZ surveys can constrain and simple line-of-sight integrals through the\nthree dimensional cluster. We illustrate the parameter constraints and\ncorrespondence to line-of-sight integrals using 3D Nbody + hydro cluster\nsimulations and a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We show that adding an\nindependent T_e measurement to upcoming SZ data breaks the parameter\ndegeneracy.

We analyze steady states of various multi-state\ndisease propagation models with heterogeneous contact rates. In many models,\nheterogeneity simply decreases epidemic thresholds. However, in models with\ncompeting pathogens and mutation, coexistence of different pathogens for small\ninfection rates requires network-independent conditions in addition to\nheterogeneity in contact rates. Furthermore, models without spontaneous\nneighbor-independent state transitions, such as cyclically competing species,\ndo not show heterogeneity effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2005 10:43:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2006 02:06:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2006 13:08:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 7 Oct 2006 04:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This paper illustrates both that oracles can give us nontrivial\ninsights about the barrier problems in circuit complexity, and that they need\nnot prevent us from trying to solve those problems.\n  First, we give an oracle relative to which PP has linear-sized circuits, by\nproving a new lower bound for perceptrons and low- degree threshold\npolynomials. This oracle settles a longstanding open question, and generalizes\nearlier results due to Beigel and to Buhrman, Fortnow, and Thierauf. More\nimportantly, it implies the first nonrelativizing separation of \"traditional\"\ncomplexity classes, as opposed to interactive proof classes such as MIP and\nMA-EXP. For Vinodchandran showed, by a nonrelativizing argument, that PP does\nnot have circuits of size n^k for any fixed k. We present an alternative proof\nof this fact, which shows that PP does not even have quantum circuits of size\nn^k with quantum advice. To our knowledge, this is the first nontrivial lower\nbound on quantum circuit size.\n  Second, we study a beautiful algorithm of Bshouty et al. for learning Boolean\ncircuits in ZPP^NP.

Thus, classes\nsuch as ZPP^||NP inhabit a \"twilight zone,\" where we need to distinguish\nbetween relativizing and black-box techniques.

We find that a two state\nmodel can describe the experimental force velocity relation and qualitative\ndependence of ATP concentration. The results indicate that the dynamics is\nlimited by an ATP-dependent step at low load and a force-dependent step at high\nload, and that at least one step is effectively irreversible in the measured\nrange of forces. The irreversible nature of the sub-step(s) lead to interesting\npredictions for future experiments: We find different parameterizations with\nmathematically identical force velocity relations but different fluctuations\n(diffusion constant).

This eliminates the need for storage of the wave\nfunction in the whole structure, which obviously strongly relaxes the memory\nrequirements and enhances the computational speed. The second advantage of this\nmethod is that it can easily account for the infinite extension of the\nstructure both into the air and into the space occupied by the photonic crystal\nby making use of the so-called \"surface Green's functions\". This eliminates the\nspurious solutions (often present in the conventional FDTD methods) related to\ne.g. waves reflected from the boundaries defining the computational domain.

In this\ntheory of electromagnetism the general laws are expressed as geometric\n(coordinate-free) relations between quantities on a four-dimensional spacetime\nmanifold. Based on these laws, and exterior calculus on metric spaces, we\nderive fields and relations that describe electromagnetism from the inside\nperspective of Lorentz observers, inside the Minkowski spacetime (the ordinary\nflat spacetime). It is shown how fields and relations defined on the spacetime\nare sliced into three-dimensional fields and relations on time slices, and that\nLorentz observers perceive these as time-dependent fields and relations on a\nsingle three-dimensional Euclidean space. In exterior calculus (on metric\nspaces) each field is associated to four field variants from which one can\nchoose how a field is to appear. Using this feature, we derive alternative\nequation systems describing electromagnetism from the inside perspective. In\none system, A, all field quantities are form fields. In another system, C, the\nfields are represented as vector and scalar fields.
