We propose that the spectral distributions of magnetic energy and\nmagnetic helicity can be found as eigenmodes of a self-adjoint,\nSchr\\\"odinger-type system of evolution equations. We argue that large-scale and\nsmall-scale magnetic fluctuations cannot be effectively separated, and that the\nconventional alpha-model is, in general, not an adequate description of the\nlarge-scale dynamo mechanism. As a consequence, the correct numerical modeling\nof such processes should resolve magnetic fluctuations down to the very small,\nresistive scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2005 02:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2005 20:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this case it is found that although the mass\ndistribution does not change significantly, matter caught onto highly eccentric\norbits is transported surprisingly far inside the disc. The captured mass\npartly replenishes the disc, but has a much lower angular momentum. This can\nlead to a reduction of the angular momentum in the entire disc and thus\nconsiderably increased accretion shortly after the encounter as well as in the\nlong term.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2005 08:23:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Our\nextensive dataset is a factor of 2 larger and spans a time interval about 4\ntimes longer than the ones considered previously for this GRB afterglow; this\nallows a more thorough analysis of its light curve and of the GRB host galaxy\nproperties. The afterglow light curves show a single power-law temporal\ndecline, modified at late times by light from a host galaxy with moderate\nintrinsic extinction, and possibly by an emerging supernova (SN). The afterglow\nevolution is interpreted within the classical \"fireball\" scenario as a weakly\ncollimated adiabatic shock propagating in the interstellar medium. The presence\nof a SN light curve superimposed on the non-thermal afterglow emission is\ninvestigated: while in the optical bands no significant contribution to the\ntotal light is found from a SN, the NIR J-band data show an excess which is\nconsistent with a SN as bright as the known hypernova SN1998bw.

The resulting splitting is due to\nthree effects, the first is the intra atomic 4f-5d spin-spin interaction, the\nsecond one is the spin - orbit interaction for 5d electrons and the third one\nis their hybridization with the valence band states of semiconductors host. The\nresulting splitting significantly depends on the relative position of 5d level\nwith respect to semiconductor host band structure. We also discuss different\nmodel, already known in the literature, which is also based on ion - band\nstates hybridization.

For a given set F of facilities, the cost of serving a\ncustomer u is the minimum distance between u and a facility in F.

The algorithm is c-cost-competitive\nif the cost of each set is at most c times the cost of the optimum set of size\nk. We give improved incremental algorithms for the metric version: an\n8-cost-competitive deterministic algorithm, a 2e ~ 5.44-cost-competitive\nrandomized algorithm, a (24+epsilon)-cost-competitive, poly-time deterministic\nalgorithm, and a (6e+epsilon ~ .31)-cost-competitive, poly-time randomized\nalgorithm.\n  The algorithm is s-size-competitive if the cost of the kth set is at most the\nminimum cost of any set of size k, and has size at most s k.

Supersymmetry is\ndynamically broken at a scale \\Lambda \\approx (10 - 100) TeV, which is\ntransmitted to the supersymmetric standard model sector through standard model\ngauge interactions. The dynamical supersymmetry breaking sector possesses an\napproximate global SU(5) symmetry, whose SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) subgroup is\nexplicitly gauged and identified as the standard model gauge group.

For\nalgebras defined by quivers (i.e. directed graphs) with relations the\ncomputation of the entries of the Cartan matrix amounts to counting nonzero\npaths in the quivers, leading naturally to a combinatorial setting. In this\npaper we study a refined version, so-called q-Cartan matrices, where each\nnonzero path is weighted by a power of an indeterminant q according to its\nlength. Specializing q=1 gives the classical Cartan matrix. Our main motivation\nare derived module categories and their invariants: the invariant factors, and\nhence the determinant, of the Cartan matrix are preserved by derived\nequivalences. The paper deals with the important class of (skewed-) gentle\nalgebras which occur naturally in representation theory, especially in the\ncontext of derived categories. These algebras are defined in purely\ncombinatorial terms. We determine normal forms for the Cartan matrices of\n(skewed-) gentle algebras. In particular, we give explicit combinatorial\nformulae for the invariant factors and thus also for the determinant of the\nCartan matrices of skewed-gentle algebras.

The flow state in the annulus strongly influences the\nperformance of fluid transportation in the devices. Therefore, the\ndetermination of flow state which is laminar flow or turbulent flow is an\nimportant task to predict the performance of the flow devices. In previous\nworks, we have proposed an energy gradient method for studying the flow\ninstability and turbulent transition. In this method, it is shown that the flow\ninstability and turbulent transition in wall bounded shear flows depend on the\nrelative magnitude of the gradient of the total mechanical energy in transverse\ndirection and the rate of loss of the total mechanical energy along the\nstreamwise direction for a given imposed disturbance. For pipe and plane\nPoiseuille flows, it has been demonstrated that the transition to turbulence\nfor these wall bounded parallel flows occurs at a consistent value of the\nenergy gradient parameter (Kmax). In present study, the critical condition for\nturbulent transition in annulus flow is calculated with the energy gradient\nmethod for various radius ratios. The critical flow rate and critical Reynolds\nnumber are given for various radius ratios. Then, the analytical results are\ncompared with the experiments in the literature.
