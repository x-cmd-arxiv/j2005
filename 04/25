The face-on view provides a novel perspective on peanuts which would\nallow study of their relation to bars and disks in greater detail than hitherto\npossible. The diagnostic is based on the fact that peanut shapes are associated\nwith a flat density distribution in the vertical direction. We show that the\nkinematic signature corresponding to such a distribution is a minimum in the\nfourth-order Gauss-Hermite moment $s_4$. We demonstrate our method on $N$-body\nsimulations of varying peanut strength, showing that strong peanuts can be\nrecognized to inclinations $i \\simeq 30\\degrees$, regardless of the strength of\nthe bar. We also consider compound systems in which a bulge is present in the\ninitial conditions as may happen if bulges form at high redshift through\nmergers. We show that in this case, because the vertical structure of the bulge\nis not derived from that of the disk, that the signature of a peanut in $s_4$\nis weakened. Thus the same kinematic signature of peanuts can be used to\nexplore bulge formation mechanisms. The observational requirements for\nidentifying peanuts with this method are challenging, but feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2005 16:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The fraction of parallax events with\ndelta chi^2 > 50 in the OGLE-II database is around ~1%, though higher fractions\nare reported by some other surveys.

While\naddressing these two issues we observed, (1) variation of conductance among the\ngraphite ribbons on the surface of HOPG.

Previous approaches assumed a threshold-based link\nlayer model in which a packet transmission is successful if the SINR at the\nreceiver is greater than a fixed threshold. In reality, the mapping from SINR\nto packet success probability is continuous. Hence, over each hop, for every\nfinite SINR, there is a non-zero probability of packet loss. With this more\nrealistic link model, it is shown that for a broad class of routing and\nscheduling schemes, a fixed fraction of hops on each route have a fixed\nnon-zero packet loss probability. In a large network, a packet travels an\nasymptotically large number of hops from source to destination. Consequently,\nit is shown that the cumulative effect of per-hop packet loss results in a\nper-node throughput of only O(1/n) (instead of Theta(1/sqrt{n log{n}})) as\nshown previously for the threshold-based link model).\n  A scheduling scheme is then proposed to counter this effect. The proposed\nscheme improves the link SINR by using conservative spatial reuse, and improves\nthe per-node throughput to O(1/(K_n sqrt{n log{n}})), where each cell gets a\ntransmission opportunity at least once every K_n slots, and K_n tends to\ninfinity as n tends to infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2005 01:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

Each of the molecules\nis found to have a heavy-atom skeleton in the form of a trigonal bipyramid\n(TBP) with Cl atoms in the axial positions, in accord with their vibrational\nspectra. The TBP is somewhat distorted in the case of Me2NbCl3 with the two\naxial Nb-Cl bonds bent away from the equatorial, slightly shorter Nb-Cl bond.\nIn the case of Me3NbCl2, moreover, the X-ray model suggests structural\ndistortions away from the idealized C3h geometry, in line with the results of\nquantum chemical calculations. The electronic structures of Me2NbCl3 and\nMe3NbCl2 have been explored by rigorous analysis of both the wavefunction and\nthe topology of the electron density, employing DFT calculations. Hence the\nstructures of these compounds are shown to reflect repulsion between the Nb-C\nand Nb-Cl bonding electron density and charge concentrations induced by the\nmethyl ligands in the valence shell of the Nb atom and arising mainly from use\nof Nb(4d) functions in the Nb-C bonds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2005 12:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
