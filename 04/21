From our calculations, we predict that ultrathin\nMnSi films are FM with sizable spin magnetic moments at the Mn atoms, while\nFeSi and NiSi films are nonmagnetic. However, CoSi films display itinerant\nferromagnetism. For the $M_2$MnSi films with Heusler-type structure, the MnSi\ntermination is found to have the highest thermodynamic stability. In the FM\nground state, the calculated strength of the effective coupling between the\nmagnetic moments of Mn atoms within the same layer approximately scales with\nthe measured Curie temperatures of the bulk $M_2$MnSi compounds. In particular,\nthe Co$_2$MnSi/Si(001) thin film has a robust FM ground state as in the bulk,\nand is found to be stable against a phase separation into CoSi/Si(001) and\nMnSi/Si(001) films. Hence this material is of possible use in FM-Si\nheterojunctions and deserves further experimental investigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2005 16:48:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2005 22:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A goal of\ncomputational and systems biology is to go beyond identification towards an\nexplanation of specific modules and essential genes and reactions in terms of\nspecific structural or evolutionary constraints. In the metabolic networks of\nE. coli, S. cerevisiae and S. aureus, we identified metabolites with a low\ndegree of connectivity, particularly those that are produced and/or consumed in\njust a single reaction. Using FBA we also determined reactions essential for\ngrowth in these metabolic networks. We find that most reactions identified as\nessential in these networks turn out to be those involving the production or\nconsumption of low degree metabolites. Applying graph theoretic methods to\nthese metabolic networks, we identified connected clusters of these low degree\nmetabolites. The genes involved in several operons in E. coli are correctly\npredicted as those of enzymes catalyzing the reactions of these clusters. We\nindependently identified clusters of reactions whose fluxes are perfectly\ncorrelated. We find that the composition of the latter `functional clusters' is\nalso largely explained in terms of clusters of low degree metabolites in each\nof these organisms. Our findings mean that most metabolic reactions that are\nessential can be tagged by one or more low degree metabolites. Those reactions\nare essential because they are the only ways of producing or consuming their\nrespective tagged metabolites. Furthermore, reactions whose fluxes are strongly\ncorrelated can be thought of as `glued together' by these low degree\nmetabolites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2005 18:43:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2005 18:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
