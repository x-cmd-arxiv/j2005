Griffiths considers that this example is\nconceptually very close to quantum nonlocality or superluminality,i.e. quantum\nbreaking of the famous Bell inequality. Or, generally, he suggests implicitly\nan absolute asymmetric duality (subluminality vs. superluminality) principle in\nany fundamental physical theory.It, he hopes, can be used for a natural\ninterpretation of the quantum mechanics too. But we explain that such\nGriffiths's interpretation retires implicitly but significantly from usual,\nCopenhagen interpretation of the standard quantum mechanical formalism. Within\nCopenhagen interpretation basic complementarity principle represents, in fact,\na dynamical symmetry principle (including its spontaneous breaking, i.e.\neffective hiding by measurement). Similarly, in other fundamental physical\ntheories instead of Griffiths's absolute asymmetric duality principle there is\na dynamical symmetry (including its spontaneous breaking, i.e. effective hiding\nin some of these theories) principle. Finally, we show that Griffiths's example\nof the bug shadow superluminal motion is definitely incorrect (it sharply\ncontradicts the remarkable Roemer's determination of the speed of light by\ncoming late of Jupiter's first moon shadow).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2005 13:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
