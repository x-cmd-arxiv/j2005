In the brane-world\nscenario, our Universe is a four-dimensional subspace or {\\em brane} embedded\nin a higher-dimensional {\\em bulk} spacetime. Ordinary matter fields are\nconfined to the brane while the gravitational field can also propagate in the\nbulk, leading to modifications of Einstein's theory of general relativity at\nhigh energies. In particular, the Randall-Sundrum-type models are\nself-consistent and simple and allow for an investigation of the essential\nnon-linear gravitational dynamics. The governing field equations induced on the\nbrane differ from the general relativistic equations in that there are nonlocal\neffects from the free gravitational field in the bulk, transmitted via the\nprojection of the bulk Weyl tensor, and the local quadratic energy-momentum\ncorrections, which are significant in the high-energy regime close to the\ninitial singularity. In this review we discuss the asymptotic dynamical\nevolution of spatially homogeneous brane-world cosmological models containing\nboth a perfect fluid and a scalar field close to the initial singularity. Using\ndynamical systems techniques it is found that, for models with a physically\nrelevant equation of state, an isotropic singularity is a past-attractor in all\northogonal spatially homogeneous models (including Bianchi type IX models). In\naddition, we describe the dynamics in a class of inhomogeneous brane-world\nmodels, and show that these models also have an isotropic initial singularity.\nThese results provide support for the conjecture that typically the initial\ncosmological singularity is isotropic in brane-world cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2005 18:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
