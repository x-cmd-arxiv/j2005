Cosmic mimicry is characterized by the\nfact that, at low redshifts, the Hubble parameter in the braneworld model is\nvirtually indistinguishable from that in the LCDM cosmology. An important point\nto note is that the \\Omega_m parameters in the braneworld model and in the LCDM\ncosmology can nevertheless be quite different. Thus, at high redshifts (early\ntimes), the braneworld asymptotically expands like a matter-dominated universe\nwith the value of \\Omega_m inferred from the observations of the local matter\ndensity. At low redshifts (late times), the braneworld model behaves almost\nexactly like the LCDM model but with a renormalized value of the cosmological\ndensity parameter \\Omega_m^{LCDM}. The redshift which characterizes cosmic\nmimicry is related to the parameters in the higher-dimensional braneworld\nLagrangian. Cosmic mimicry is a natural consequence of the scale-dependence of\ngravity in braneworld models. The change in the value of the cosmological\ndensity parameter is shown to be related to the spatial dependence of the\neffective gravitational constant in braneworld theory.

None\nof the investigated systems of this study yields conditions that are promising\nto launch a GRB. While we cannot completely exclude that a subset of neutron\nstar black hole binaries, maybe black holes with low masses and very large\ninitial spins, can produce a GRB, this seems to happen -if at all- only in a\nrestricted region of the available parameter space. I argue that the difficulty\nto form promising disks together with the absence of any observed neutron star\nblack hole binary may mean that they are insignificant as central engines of\nthe observed, short-hard GRBs and that the vast majority of the latter ones is\ncaused by double neutron star coalescences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2005 14:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Essentially,\nthis is the quantum separability problem.\n  Chapters 1 to 3 motivate a new interior-point algorithm which, given the\nexpected values of a subset of an orthogonal basis of observables of an\notherwise unknown quantum state, searches for an entanglement witness in the\nspan of the subset of observables. When all the expected values are known, the\nalgorithm solves the separability problem. In Chapter 4, I give the motivation\nfor the algorithm and show how it can be used in a particular physical scenario\nto detect entanglement (or decide separability) of an unknown quantum state\nusing as few quantum resources as possible. I then explain the intuitive idea\nbehind the algorithm and relate it to the standard algorithms of its kind. I\nend the chapter with a comparison of the complexities of the algorithms\nsurveyed in Chapter 3. Finally, in Chapter 5, I present the details of the\nalgorithm and discuss its performance relative to standard methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2005 16:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2005 12:11:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2006 15:47:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For many applications in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, geocasting\nis an important and frequent communication service. The challenging problem in\ngeocasting is distributing the packets to all the nodes within the geocast\nregion with high probability but with low overhead. According to our study we\nnotice a clear tradeoff between the proportion of nodes in the geocast region\nthat receive the packet and the overhead incurred by the geocast packet\nespecially at low densities and irregular distributions. We present two novel\nprotocols for geocasting that achieve high delivery rate and low overhead by\nutilizing the local location information of nodes to combine geographic routing\nmechanisms with region flooding. We show that the first protocol\nGeographic-Forwarding-Geocast (GFG) has close-to-minimum overhead in dense\nnetworks and that the second protocol Geographic-Forwarding-Perimeter-Geocast\n(GFPG) provides guaranteed delivery without global flooding or global network\ninformation even at low densities and with the existence of region gaps or\nobstacles. An adaptive version of the second protocol (GFPG*) has the desirable\nproperty of perfect delivery at all densities and close-to-minimum overhead at\nhigh densities. We evaluate our mechanisms and compare them using simulation to\nother proposed geocasting mechanisms. The results show the significant\nimprovement in delivery rate (up to 63% higher delivery percentage in low\ndensity networks) and reduction in overhead (up to 80% reduction) achieved by\nour mechanisms. We hope for our protocols to become building block mechanisms\nfor dependable sensor network architectures that require robust efficient\ngeocast services.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2005 18:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For a N-body system these\nlatter are usually described by a set of Jacobi normal coordinates, based on\nthe clustering of the centers of mass of sub-clusters. The Jacobi variables are\nthen the starting point for separating {\\it orientational} variables, connected\nwith the angular momentum constants of motion, from {\\it shape} (or {\\it\nvibrational}) variables. Jacobi variables, however, cannot be extended to\nspecial relativity.

The underlying group-theoretical\nstructure allows a direct extension of such notions from a non-relativistic to\na special- relativistic context if one exploits the {\\it rest-frame instant\nform of dynamics}.

The separation of suitable relative variables from the so-called\n{\\it canonical internal} center of mass leads to the correct kinematical\nframework for the relativistic theory of the orbits for a N-body system with\naction -at-a-distance interactions.

We focus on the problem of finding a suitable starting\npoint for perturbative calculations near the unitary limit (k_Fa)->infinity and\n(k_Fr)-> 0, where k_F is the Fermi momentum, a is the scattering length and r\nis the effective range. We try to clarify the relationship between different\nclasses of diagrams and the large g and large D approximations, where g is the\nfermion degeneracy and D is the number of space time dimensions. In the large D\nlimit we find that the energy per particle in the strongly interacting system\nis 1/2 the result for free fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2005 19:14:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 May 2005 20:48:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2005 13:45:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
