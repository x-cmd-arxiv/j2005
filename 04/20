Elementary flare bursts have been\ninterpreted as instabilities or oscillations of the reconnection process\nleading to an unsteady release of magnetic energy. These interpretations based\non two-dimensional concepts cannot explain these observations, showing that the\nflare elements are displaced in a third dimension along the arcade. Therefore,\nthe observed flare elements are not a modulation of the reconnection process,\nbut originate as this process progresses along an arcade of magnetic loops.\nContrary to previous reports, we find no correlation between footpoint motion\nand hard X-ray flux. This flare apparently contradicts the predictions of the\nstandard translation invariant 2.5D reconnection models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2005 10:30:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Such entanglement, apart from its conceptual novelty, is the\nprerequisite for a far-reaching goal: teleportation of the flux and charge\nvariables between JJs, implementing the transfer of an unknown quantum state\nalong a network of such devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2005 13:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper we introduce a new set of necessary conditions for\nseparability of multipartite states, obtained from a set of positive but not\ncompletely positive maps. These conditions can be thought of as generalisations\nof the reduction criterion to multipartite systems. We use tripartite Werner\nstates as an example to investigate the entanglement detecting powers of some\nof these new conditions, and we also look at what these conditions mean in\nterms of distillation.
