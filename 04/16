We find that to keep the 0.8-7.0 keV band background\nmodeling uncertainty tolerable, one has to use a much more restrictive filter\nthan that commonly applied. In particular, because flares have highly variable\nspectra, not all of them are identified by filtering the E>10 keV light curve.\nWe tried using the outer part of the EPIC FOV for monitoring the background in\na softer band (1-5 keV). We find that one needs to discard the time periods\nwhen either the hard-band or the soft-band rate exceeds the nominal value by\nmore than 20% in order to limit the 90% CL background uncertainty to between 5%\nat E=4-7 keV and 20% at E=0.8-1 keV, for both MOS and PN. This compares to a\n10-30% respective PN uncertainty when only the hard-band light curve is used\nfor filtering, and to a 15-45% PN uncertainty when applying the commonly used\n2-3 sigma filtering method. We illustrate our method on a nearby cluster A1795.\nThe above background uncertainties convert into the systematic temperature\nuncertainties between 1% at r=3-4 arcmin and 20--25% (~1 keV for A1795) at\nr=10-15 arcmin. For comparison, the commonly applied 2-3 sigma clipping of the\nhard-band light curve misses a significant amount of flares, rendering the\ntemperatures beyond r=10 arcmin unconstrained. Thus, the background\nuncertainties do not prohibit the EPIC temperature profile analysis of\nlow-brightness regions, like outer regions of galaxy clusters, provided a\nconservative flare filtering such as the double filtering method with 20%\nlimits is used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2005 12:38:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2005 16:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We\nconsider the class of general homogeneous, isotropic initial states for quantum\nscalar fields in Robertson-Walker (RW) spacetimes, subject to the requirement\nthat their ultraviolet behavior be consistent with renormalizability of the\ncovariantly conserved stress tensor which couples to gravity. In the functional\nSchr\\\"odinger picture such states are coherent, squeezed, mixed states\ncharacterized by a Gaussian density matrix. This Gaussian has parameters which\napproach those of the adiabatic vacuum at large wave number, and evolve in time\naccording to an effective classical Hamiltonian. The one complex parameter\nfamily of $\\alpha$ squeezed states in de Sitter spacetime does not fall into\nthis UV allowed class, except for the special value of the parameter\ncorresponding to the Bunch-Davies state. We determine the finite contributions\nto the inflationary power spectrum and stress tensor expectation value of\ngeneral UV allowed adiabatic states, and obtain quantitative limits on the\nobservability and backreaction effects of some recently proposed models of\nshort distance modifications of the initial state of inflation.

We use the flux tube model where the effective Column\ncoefficient and string tension are extracted from the lattice QCD calculations,\nto obtain the interactions among the constituent quarks, which is later to be\ntaken as an effective potential. It is reasonable to assume that keeping the\nsimple spatial shape, only the breathing mode is considered, thus the whole\nsystem is much simplified and described by only one variable. Substituting the\npotential into the Schr\\\"odinger equation, we evaluate the binding energy of\nthe system. We find that each of the configuration has higher symmetries and\ncorresponds to a local minimum of energy and one of them results in a mass\nwhich is smaller than the others. It is interesting to notice that with such a\nvery simplified semi-classical picture the minimal value corresponds to a mass\nof 1530 to 1554 MeV for $\\Theta^+_5$. The good agreement with the LEPS' data\nmay indicate that such simplified picture indeed reflects physical reality in\nsome sense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2005 12:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
