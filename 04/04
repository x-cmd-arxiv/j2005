The concept of an angle structure on a tetrahedron and\non a triangulated closed 3-manifold is introduced following the work of Casson,\nMurakami and Rivin. It is proved by A.

The moduli space\nof all angle structures on a triangulated 3-manifold is a bounded open convex\npolytope in a Euclidean space. The volume of an angle structure is defined.\nBoth the angle structure and the volume are natural generalizations of\ntetrahedra in the constant sectional curvature spaces and their volume.

This allows very efficient application of the electric field,\nup to 2 kV/cm in a rather dense superheated vapor, even when significant\nphotoemission takes place at the windows during pulsed laser irradiation. The\nbody of the cell is made of sapphire or alumina ceramic to prevent large\ncurrents resulting from surface conduction observed in cesiated glass cells.\nThe technique used to attach the monocrystalline sapphire windows to the cell\nbody causes minimal stress birefringence in the windows. In addition,\nreflection losses at the windows can be made very small. The vapor cell\noperates with no buffer gas and has no magnetic part. The use of this kind of\ncell has resulted in an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio in the\nmeasurement of Parity Violation in cesium vapor underway at ENS, Paris.

The free energy\npenalty associated with the brush modifies both the hybridization isotherms and\nthe rate equations: the attainable hybridization is lowered significantly as is\nthe hybridization rate.
