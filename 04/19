We suggest that the feedback energy liberated by accretion\nmust pass through the accreting material, in an energy-conserving flux close-in\nand a momentum-conserving flux further out. If the inflowing gas dominates the\ngravitational potential outside the Bondi radius, feedback from\nEddington-limited accretion drives the density profile of the gas to that of a\nsingular isothermal sphere. We find that the velocity dispersion associated\nwith the isothermal potential, sigma, increases with time as the black hole\nmass M grows, in such a way that M is proportional to sigma^4. The coefficient\nof this proportionality depends on the radius at which the flow switches from\nenergy conserving to momentum conserving, and gives the observed M-sigma\nrelation if the transition occurs at ~100 Schwarzschild radii. We associate\nthis transition with radiative cooling and show that bremsstrahlung, strongly\nboosted by inverse Compton scattering in a two-temperature (T_p >> T_e) plasma,\nleads to a transition at the desired radius.\n  According to this picture, bulge masses M_b are insensitive to the virial\nmasses of their dark matter haloes, but correlate linearly with black hole\nmass.

The model naturally explains why the\nM-sigma relation has less scatter than either the M-M_b (Magorrian) or the\nFaber-Jackson relation.

The existence of such a correlation, over more\nthan two orders of magnitude spread in metallicity, is likely to be the\nconsequence of an underlying mass-metallicity relation for the galaxies\nresponsible for DLA absorption lines.

We demonstrate that when the applied magnetic\nfield is parallel to the magnetization of the triangle, the giant vortex state\nof vorticity three splits into three individual F0-vortices, due to a\npronounced influence of the C3 symmetry of the magnetic triangle. As a result\nof a strong pinning of the three vortices by the triangle, their configuration\nremains stable in a broad range of applied magnetic fields. For sufficiently\nhigh fields, F0-vortices merge and the nucleation occurs through the giant\nvortex state. The theoretical analysis of this novel reentrant behaviour at the\nphase boundary, obtained within the Ginzburg - Landau formalism, is in\nexcellent agreement with the experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2005 08:11:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The neutrino mass scale is determined by the bulk mass term\n(alpha_{S}) of the singlet as ve^{-2(alpha_{S}-1)*pi*kR}. This suppression is\ndue to a small overlap between the profile of the singlet zero mode and the\ntriplet, which is confined to the TeV brane. The generic form for the neutrino\nmass matrix due to the overlap between the fermions is not compatible with the\nLMA solution. This is overcome by imposing a Z_{4} symmetry, which is softly\nbroken by couplings of the triplet Higgs to the lepton doublets. This model\nsuccessfully reproduces the observed masses and mixing angles in charged lepton\nsector as well as in the neutrino sector, in addition to having a prediction of\n|U_{e3}| ~ O(0.01).

This box, inspired from the\nCHSH inequality, was first proposed by Popescu and Rohrlich to examine the\nquestion: given that a maximally entangled pair of qubits is non-local, why is\nit not maximally non-local? We believe that understanding the power of this box\nwill yield insight into the non-locality of quantum mechanics. It was shown\nrecently by Cerf, Gisin, Massar and Popescu, that this imaginary device is able\nto simulate correlations from any measurement on a singlet state. Here, we show\nthat the non-local box can in fact do much more: through the simulation of the\nmagic square pseudo-telepathy game and the Mermin-GHZ pseudo-telepathy game, we\nshow that the non-local box can simulate quantum correlations that no entangled\npair of qubits can in a bipartite scenario and even in a multi-party scenario.\nFinally we show that a single non-local box cannot simulate all quantum\ncorrelations and propose a generalization for a multi-party non-local box.

We consider\nhere the simplest case, termed quantum state filtering, when the $N$ given\nnon-orthogonal states, $\\{|\\psi_{1} >,..., |\\psi_{N} > \\}$, are divided into\ntwo sets and the first set consists of one state only while the second consists\nof all of the remaining states.
