This star was observed during eight nights\nwith the spectrograph HARPS at La Silla Observatory. Forty three p-modes have\nbeen identified (Bouchy et al. 2005). In the present paper, we discuss the\nmodelisation of this star. We computed stellar models iterated to present the\nsame observable parameters (luminosity, effective temperature, outer chemical\ncomposition) while the internal structure was different according to the two\nextreme assumptions : original overmetallicity or accretion. We show that in\nany case the seismic constraints lead to models in complete agreement with the\nexternal parameters deduced from spectroscopy and from the Hipparcos parallax\n(L and Teff). We discuss the tests which may lead to a choice between the two\ntypical scenarios. We show that the ``small separation'' seem to give a better\nfit for the accretion case than for the overmetallic case, but in spite of the\nvery good data the uncertainties are still too large to conclude. We discuss\nthe observations which would be needed to go further and solve this question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2005 20:54:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2005 09:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

A uniform\ndistribution of kick velocities constrained to the orbital plane would result\nin ~24% of surviving binaries coalescing at least 10,000 times faster than an\nunperturbed circular system. Even if the planar kick constraint is lifted, ~6%\nof bound systems still coalesce this rapidly.

For AFGL 2591 and NGC 7538 IRS9, the emission is single-peaked,\nwhile for the highest luminosity source, W33A, a `mini-cluster' of three\nsources is detected. The derived sizes, flux densities, and broad-band radio\nspectra of the sources support recent models where the initial expansion of HII\nregions around very young O-type stars is prevented by stellar gravity. In\nthese models, accretion flows onto high-mass stars originate in large-scale\nmolecular envelopes and become ionized close to the star.

We apply this requirement to slow-roll inflation with\nnon-adiabatic initial conditions, and to cyclic cosmology. This allows us to\ndefine in a precise sense when some of these models are fine-tuned.
