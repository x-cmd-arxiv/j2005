The equivalent velocity dispersion is sigma_lens=310\nkm/s, in excellent agreement with the measured stellar dispersion sigma_v=320\nkm/s.

It is thought that matter was generated, the structures in the Universe\nwere formed and cold dark matter froze out during this very early epoch when\nthe equation of state of the Universe was dominated by the quark-gluon plasma\n(QGP). Future Little Bangs may reveal the mechanism of matter generation and\nthe nature of cold dark matter. Knowledge of the QGP will be an essential\ningredient in quantitative understanding of the very early Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2005 15:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-11"}

(2) The BAL trough\n(BALnicity index 2990 km/s) is detached by 21000 km/s and extends to velocity v\n= -29000 km/s. There are additional intrinsic absorbers at -1900 and -2800\nkm/s. (3) The radio rotation measure of the quasar, 18350 rad/m^2, is the\nsecond-highest known.\n  The radio luminosity is P(1.4GHz) = 4.3 x 10^27 W/Hz (H0 = 50 km/s/Mpc, q0 =\n0.5), radio loudness R* = 260. The radio source is compact (<~ 2.8 kpc) and the\nradio spectrum is GHz-peaked, consistent with it being relatively young. The\nwidth of the CIV emission line, in conjunction with the total optical\nluminosity, implies black-hole mass ~ 10^9 M(sun), L/L(Eddington) ~ 2.

The type of the parton (quark, gluon) and the energy fraction x of\nthe parton exiting emission chain (entering hard process) are predefined, i.e.\nconstrained throughout the evolution. Such a constraint is mandatory for any\nrealistic MC for the initial state QCD parton shower. We add one important\ncondition: the MC algorithm must not require the a priori knowledge of the full\nnumerical exact solutions of the evolution equations, as is the case in the\npopular ``Markovian MC for backward evolution''. Our aim is to find at least\none solution of this problem that would function in practice. Finding such a\nsolution seems to be definitely within the reach of the currently available\ncomputer CPUs and the sophistication of the modern MC techniques. We describe\nin this work the first example of an efficient solution of this kind. Its\nnumerical implementation is still restricted to the pure gluon-strahlung.

The aim of this paper is to study the\nrelation between these two Cartan geometries for Lagrangean contact structures\nand partially integrable almost CR structures.\n  We develop a general method for extending Cartan geometries which generalizes\nthe Cartan geometry interpretation of Fefferman's construction of a conformal\nstructure associated to a CR structure.

On the\none hand, this shows that the homogeneous models for the two parabolic contact\nstructures give rise to examples of non-flat path geometries with large\nautomorphism groups. On the other hand, we show that one may (almost)\nreconstruct the underlying torsion free parabolic contact structure from the\nCartan curvature associated to the chains.

Revised version with corrected definition\n  in abstract and few other (very) minor changes","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  A black box with two input bits and two output bits is called a non-local PR\nbox, if the XOR of the output bits equals the AND of the input bits. In a\nrecent article, Cerf et al. show that Alice and Bob, using such a PR box, can\neffectively simulate entanglement without the need of communication. We show\nthat an adaptation of a model due to Dirk Aerts, yields a realistic simulation\nof the non-local PR box without communication. Because the model is entirely\nrealistic, it cannot violate relativistic constraints. Like a non-local box, it\ncan be used to simulate the singlet state coincidence probabilities, but the\ntime to complete the observation of the outcome will exceed the time it takes a\nphoton to travel one arm in an EPRB setup. The model explicitly shows how to\nproduce an outcome that is locally perfectly random, but nevertheless\ndetermines what happens in the other wing of the experiment, without\ncommunication taking place between the two wings. In this sense, it can serve\nas an accurate metaphor for the mechanism of entanglement. The model\nconsiderably strengthens the claim that no communication is necessary to\nsimulate entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2005 12:52:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2005 11:55:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2005 19:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
