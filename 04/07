According to our analysis, several\naspects of this feature support a mass-ejection model of the observed\nspectroscopic events, and not an eclipse model. The He II emission appeared in\nearly 2003, grew to a brief maximum during the 2003.5 spectroscopic event, and\nthen abruptly disappeared. It did not appear in any other HST spectra before or\nafter the event. The peak brightness was larger than previously reported, and\nis difficult to explain even if one allows for an uncertainty factor of order\n3. The stellar wind must provide a temporary larger-than-normal energy supply,\nand we describe a special form of radiative amplification that may also be\nneeded.

The super-critical flow is composed of two parts: the disk region\nand the outflow regions above and below the disk. Within the disk region the\ncircular motion as well as the patchy density structure are observed, which is\ncaused by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and probably by convection. The\nmass-accretion rate decreases inward, roughly in proportion to the radius, and\nthe remaining part of the disk material leaves the disk to form outflow because\nof strong radiation pressure force. We confirm that photon trapping plays an\nimportant role within the disk. Thus, matter can fall onto the black hole at a\nrate exceeding the Eddington rate. The emission is highly anisotropic and\nmoderately collimated so that the apparent luminosity can exceed the Eddington\nluminosity by a factor of a few in the face-on view. The mass-accretion rate\nonto the black hole increases with increase of the absorption opacity\n(metalicity) of the accreting matter. This implies that the black hole tends to\ngrow up faster in the metal rich regions as in starburst galaxies or\nstar-forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2005 00:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The method is based on measuring the ratio\nof the cross-correlation between DLAs and galaxies to the auto-correlation of\nthe galaxies themselves ($w_{\\rm dg}/w_{\\rm gg}$), which is (in linear theory)\nthe ratio of their bias factor. This is shown to be true irrespective of the\ngalaxy redshift distribution, provided that one uses the same galaxies for the\ntwo correlation functions. The method is applicable to all redshifts. Here, we\nfocus on z=3 DLAs and we demonstrate that the method robustly constrains the\nmean DLA halo mass using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) cosmological\nsimulations.

The cross-\ncorrelation method thus appears to yield a robust estimate of the average host\nhalo mass even though the DLAs and the galaxies occupy a broad mass spectrum of\nhalos, and massive halos contain multiple galaxies with DLAs.

In particular, we investigate the role of\nhydrodynamic and magnetic internal angular momentum transport and binary mass\nand angular momentum transfer. We follow the evolution of rotating single stars\nand of binary systems that include rotational processes for both stars.\nNeglecting magnetic fields, we show that the cores of massive single stars can\nmaintain a high specific angular momentum when evolved with the assumption that\nmean molecular weight gradients suppress rotational mixing processes. In binary\nsystems that undergo mass transfer during core hydrogen burning the mass\nreceiving star accretes large amounts of high angular momentum material,\nleading to a spin-up of the core. We find, however, that this merely\ncompensates for the tidal angular momentum loss due to spin-orbit coupling,\nwhich leads to synchronous rotation before the mass transfer event. Therefore\nthe resulting cores do not rotate faster than in single stars. We also present\nmodels that include magnetic fields generated by differential rotation and we\nconsider the internal angular momentum transport by magnetic torques. We\ninvestigate the capability of magnetic torques to efficiently pump angular\nmomentum into the cores of accreting stars.

Thus we have only as input qualitative information on\nsimilarity and no quantitative distance measure between items. The quality of a\nclustering is measured in terms of its number of agreements, which is simply\nthe number of edges it correctly classifies, that is the sum of number of -\nedges whose endpoints it places in different clusters plus the number of +\nedges both of whose endpoints it places within the same cluster.\n  In this paper, we study the problem of finding clusterings that maximize the\nnumber of agreements, and the complementary minimization version where we seek\nclusterings that minimize the number of disagreements.

In the case in which the target is a viral protein\ndisplaying a high mutation rate, a second problem arises, namely the eventual\ndevelopment of resistance. We wish to suggest a scheme for the design of\nnon--conventional drugs which do not face any of these problems and apply it to\nthe case of HIV--1 protease. It is based on the knowledge that the folding of\nsingle--domain proteins, like e.g. each of the monomers forming the HIV--1--PR\nhomodimer, is controlled by local elementary structures (LES), stabilized by\nlocal contacts among hydrophobic, strongly interacting and highly conserved\namino acids which play a central role in the folding process. Because LES have\nevolved over myriads of generations to recognize and strongly interact with\neach other so as to make the protein fold fast as well as to avoid aggregation\nwith other proteins, highly specific (and thus little toxic) as well as\neffective folding--inhibitor drugs suggest themselves: short peptides (or\neventually their mimetic molecules), displaying the same amino acid sequence of\nthat of LES (p--LES). Aside from being specific and efficient, these inhibitors\nare expected not to induce resistance: in fact, mutations which successfully\navoid their action imply the destabilization of one or more LES and thus should\nlead to protein denaturation. Making use of Monte Carlo simulations within the\nframework of a simple although not oversimplified model, which is able to\nreproduce the main thermodynamic as well as dynamic properties of monoglobular\nproteins, we first identify the LES of the HIV--1--PR and then show that the\ncorresponding p--LES peptides act as effective inhibitors of the folding of the\nprotease which do not create resistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2005 06:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
