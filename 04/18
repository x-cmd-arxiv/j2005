The conventional Markowitz\nportfolio optimisation is discussed and the shortcomings due to non-Gaussian\nsecurity returns are outlined. A method is proposed to minimise the likelihood\nof extreme non-Gaussian drawdowns of the portfolio value. The theory is called\nLeptokurtic, because it minimises the effects from \"fat tails\" of returns. The\nleptokurtic portfolio theory provides an optimal portfolio for investors, who\ndefine their risk-aversion as unwillingness to experience sharp drawdowns in\nasset prices. Two types of risks in asset returns are defined: a fluctuation\nrisk, that has Gaussian distribution, and a drawdown risk, that deals with\ndistribution tails. These risks are quantitatively measured by defining the\n\"noise kernel\" -- an ellipsoidal cloud of points in the space of asset returns.\nThe size of the ellipse is controlled with the threshold parameter: the larger\nthe threshold parameter, the larger return are accepted for investors as normal\nfluctuations. The return vectors falling into the kernel are used for\ncalculation of fluctuation risk. Analogously, the data points falling outside\nthe kernel are used for the calculation of drawdown risks. As a result the\nportfolio optimisation problem becomes three-dimensional: in addition to the\nreturn, there are two types of risks involved. Optimal portfolio for\ndrawdown-averse investors is the portfolio minimising variance outside the\nnoise kernel. The theory has been tested with MSCI North America, Europe and\nPacific total return stock indices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2005 13:09:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2005 19:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

The main\ndogma is the existence of density dependence mechanisms, which can be modelled\nwith distinct functional forms that depend on the size of the population. One\nimportant class of regulatory functions is the $\\theta$-logistic, which\ngeneralises the logistic equation. Using this model as a motivation, this paper\nintroduces a simple dynamical reformulation that generalises many growth\nfunctions. The reformulation consists of two equations, one for population\nsize, and one for the growth rate. Furthermore, the model shows that although\npopulation is density-dependent, the dynamics of the growth rate does not\ndepend either on population size, nor on the carrying capacity. Actually, the\ngrowth equation is uncoupled from the population size equation, and the model\nhas only two parameters, a Malthusian parameter $\\rho$ and a competition\ncoefficient $\\theta$.
