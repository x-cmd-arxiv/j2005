In recent surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope\nand Multiple Mirror Telescope, we have doubled the DLA Zn sample at z < 1.5.\nCombining our results with those at higher redshifts from the literature, we\nfind that the global mean metallicity of DLAs does not rise to the solar value\nat low redshifts. These surprising results appear to contradict the near-solar\nmean metallicity observed for nearby (z ~ 0) galaxies and the predictions of\ncosmic chemical evolution models based on the global star formation history.\nFinally, we discuss direct constraints on the star formation rates (SFRs) in\nthe absorber galaxies from our deep Fabry-Perot Ly-alpha imaging study and\nother emission-line studies in the literature. A large fraction of the observed\nheavy-element quasar absorbers at 0 < z < 3.4 appear to have SFRs substantially\nbelow the global mean SFR, consistent with the low metallicities observed in\nthe spectroscopic studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2005 05:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In more recent times low-dimensional models (e.g. chiral models,\nfactorizing models) often have been treated by special recipes in a way which\nsometimes led to a loss of unity of QFT. In the present work I try to\ncounteract this apartheid tendency by reviewing past results within the setting\nof the general principles of QFT. To this I add two new ideas: (1) a modular\ninterpretation of the chiral model Diff(S)-covariance with a close connection\nto the recently formulated local covariance principle for QFT in curved\nspacetime and (2) a derivation of the chiral model temperature duality from a\nsuitable operator formulation of the angular Wick rotation (in analogy to the\nNelson-Symanzik duality in the Ostertwalder-Schrader setting) for rational\nchiral theories. The SL(2,Z) modular Verlinde relation is a special case of\nthis thermal duality and (within the family of rational models) the matrix S\nappearing in the thermal duality relation becomes identified with the\nstatistics character matrix S. The relevant angular Euclideanization'' is done\nin the setting of the Tomita-Takesaki modular formalism of operator algebras.\n  I find it appropriate to dedicate this work to the memory of J. A. Swieca\nwith whom I shared the interest in two-dimensional models as a testing ground\nfor QFT for more than one decade.\n  This is a significantly extended version of an ``Encyclopedia of Mathematical\nPhysics'' contribution hep-th/0502125.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2005 14:44:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2005 00:06:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2005 16:48:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2005 12:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
