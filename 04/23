The behavior of the more general models with the\nimplicitly defined equation of state, obtained by the generalization of the\nexplicitly constructed models, is studied to gain insight into the necessary\nconditions for the occurrence of the transition, as well as to investigate the\nmechanism behind the transition. It is found that the parameters of the\ngeneralized models need to satisfy special conditions for the transition to\nhappen and that the mechanism behind the transition is the cancellation of the\ncontribution of the cosmological constant boundary. The aspects of the behavior\nof the generalized models which are not related to the transition are briefly\ndiscussed and the role of the implicitly defined dark energy equation of state\nin the description of the dark energy evolution is emphasized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2005 12:30:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2005 18:49:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2005 12:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
