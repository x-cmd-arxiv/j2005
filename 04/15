The $\\alpha$ values estimated in individual line systems\ndepend on the set of atomic transitions used and therefore the quoted\ndependence on the cosmic age may reflect the fact that different sets of\ntransitions are used at different redshifts. A correlation between line shifts\nand relative optical depths of the atomic transitions is also present.

A structure used for this task is a \"semantic\ngraph\", also known as a \"relational data graph\" or an \"attributed relational\ngraph\". These graphs encode relationships as \"typed\" links between a pair of\n\"typed\" nodes. Indeed, semantic graphs are very similar to semantic networks\nused in AI. The node and link types are related through an ontology graph (also\nknown as a schema). Furthermore, each node has a set of attributes associated\nwith it (e.g., \"age\" may be an attribute of a node of type \"person\").\nUnfortunately, the selection of types and attributes for both nodes and links\ndepends on human expertise and is somewhat subjective and even arbitrary.

RR is a general architecture proposed for service location\nand bootstrapping in ad hoc networks, in addition to data-centric storage,\nconfiguration, and task assignment in sensor networks. In RR the network\ntopology is divided into geographical regions, where each region is responsible\nfor a set of keys representing the services or data of interest. Each key is\nmapped to a region based on a hash-table-like mapping scheme. A few elected\nnodes inside each region are responsible for maintaining the mapped\ninformation.

Firstly, it is shown\nthat the theory gives a direct derivation of the implications of Dirac's large\nnumber hypothesis. The three dimensionless large numbers are obtained as three\nclosed formulae with definite coefficients constructed from known physical\nconstants. Secondly, the theory is used to derive two quantum Friedman\ncosmologies. The first of these Cosmologies is a very simple first\napproximation involving a key angular parameter being zero and the second is a\nmore accurate one involving the same key parameter not being zero. The\ncosmological constant plays a basic and fundamental part in the formalism with\nvery accurate agreement with measurement pertaining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2005 09:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The NAFL theory QM, formalizing quantum mechanics, treats\nthe superposed state ($S$) of a single photon taking two or more different\npaths at the same time as a logical contradiction that is formally unprovable\nin QM. Nevertheless, in a nonclassical NAFL model for QM in which the law of\nnoncontradiction fails, $S$ has a meaningful metamathematical interpretation\nthat the classical path information for the photon is not available. It is\nargued that the existence of an interference pattern does not logically amount\nto a proof of the self-interference of a single photon. This fact, when coupled\nwith the temporal nature of NAFL truth, implies the logical validity of the\nretroactive assertion of the path information (and the logical superfluousness\nof the grid) in Afshar's experiment. The Bohr complementarity principle, when\nproperly interpreted with the time dependence of logical truth taken into\naccount, holds in Afshar's experiment.
