In\ngeneral, the f electrons can have a (weak) dispersion, and the hopping and the\nnon-local hybridization of the d and f electrons extend over the unit cell. The\nconstruction is performed in two steps. First the Hamiltonian is cast into\npositive semi-definite form using composite operators in combination with\ncoupled non-linear matching conditions. This may be achieved in several ways,\nthus leading to solutions in different regions of the phase diagram. In a\nsecond step, a non-local product wave function in position space is constructed\nwhich allows one to identify various stability regions corresponding to\ninsulating and conducting states. The compressibility of the insulating state\nis shown to diverge at the boundary of its stability regime. The metallic phase\nis a non-Fermi liquid with one dispersing and one flat band. This state is also\nan exact ground state of the conventional PAM and has the following properties:\n(i) it is non-magnetic with spin-spin correlations disappearing in the\nthermodynamic limit, (ii) density-density correlations are short-ranged, and\n(iii) the momentum distributions of the interacting electrons are analytic\nfunctions, i.e., have no discontinuities even in their derivatives. The\nstability regions of the ground states extend through a large region of\nparameter space, e.g., from weak to strong on-site interaction U. Exact\nitinerant, ferromagnetic ground states are found at and below 1/4 filling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2005 16:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We find intriguing\ndifferences between top-performance and lower performance groups, but also\nbetween the two sets of research groups. Particularly these latter differences\nare interesting, as they may indicate the influence of research management\nstrategies. Lower performance groups have a larger scale-dependent cumulative\nadvantage than top-performance groups. We also find that regardless of\nperformance, larger groups have less not-cited publications. We introduce a\nsimple model in which processes at the micro level lead to the observed\nphenomena at the macro level. Top-performance groups are, on average, more\nsuccessful in the entire range of journal impact. We fit our findings into a\nconcept of hierarchically layered networks. In this concept, the network of\nresearch groups constitutes a layer of one hierarchical step higher than the\nbasic network of publications connected by citations. The cumulative\nsize-advantage of citations received by a group looks like preferential\nattachment in the basic network in which highly connected nodes (publications)\nincrease their connectivity faster than less connected nodes. But in our study\nit is size that causes an advantage. In general, the larger a group (node in\nthe research group network), the more incoming links this group acquires in a\nnon-linear, cumulative way. Moreover, top-performance groups are about an order\nof magnitude more efficient in creating linkages (i.e., receiving citations)\nthan the lower performance groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2005 16:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
