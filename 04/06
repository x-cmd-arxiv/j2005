We briefly speculate that this ellipticity may\nrepresent the intrinsic flattening of dark matter mini-halos in which such\noptically dim clusters might be embedded. Finally, we examine the distribution\nof clusters on the size vs.luminosity plane. Three objects fall above the sharp\nupper envelope of the main distribution on this plane: Omega Cen, M54, and NGC\n2419. All three have previously, and independently, been suggested to be the\nstripped cores of former dwarf galaxies. This suspicion is strengthened by the\nobservation that the massive cluster G1 in M31, plus a number of the most\nluminous clusters in NGC 5128 also fall in the same region of the plane. All of\nthese objects have also previously been suggested to be the stripped cores of\nnow-defunct dwarf galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2005 11:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This approach is especially effective if the parity-check\nmatrix of a code is a matrix composed of blocks of circulant permutation\nmatrices, as is the case for the class of codes known as array codes. We show\nhow to shorten array codes by deleting certain columns of their parity-check\nmatrices so as to increase their girth. The shortening approach is based on the\nobservation that for array codes, and in fact for a slightly more general class\nof LDPC codes, the cycles in the corresponding Tanner graph are governed by\ncertain homogeneous linear equations with integer coefficients. Consequently,\nwe can selectively eliminate cycles from an array code by only retaining those\ncolumns from the parity-check matrix of the original code that are indexed by\ninteger sequences that do not contain solutions to the equations governing\nthose cycles. We provide Ramsey-theoretic estimates for the maximum number of\ncolumns that can be retained from the original parity-check matrix with the\nproperty that the sequence of their indices avoid solutions to various types of\ncycle-governing equations. This translates to estimates of the rate penalty\nincurred in shortening a code to eliminate cycles.

Firstly, we\npropose a dynamical approach to explain the dark energy content of the\nuniverse.

This scalar field\ndevelopes a Hubble parameter-dependent (thus time-dependent) vacum expectation\nvalue, which renders a time-independent relative density for dark energy and\nthus can explain the coincidence of the dark energy density of the universe.\nSecondly, we assume the dark matter particle is meta-stable and decays very\nlately into the dark energy scalar field. Such a conversion of matter to dark\nenergy can give an explanation for the starting time of the accelerating\nexpansion of the universe.
