Because of their\nsimplicity and proximity, dense cores offer the clearest view of the different\nphases of star formation, in particular the conditions prior to the onset of\ngravitational collapse. Thanks to the combined analysis of the emission from\nmolecular lines and the emission/absorption from dust grains, the last several\nyears have seen a very rapid progress in our understanding of the structure and\nchemical composition of starless cores. Previous contradictions between\nmolecular tracers are now understood to arise from core chemical\ninhomogeneities, which are caused by the selective freeze out of molecules onto\ncold dust grains. The analysis of the dust emission and absorption, in\naddition, has allowed us to derive accurate density profiles, and has made\nfinally possible to carry out self consistent modeling of the internal\nstructure of starless cores. In this paper I briefly review the evolution of\ncore studies previous to the current golden age, and show how multi-tracer\nemission can now be modeled in a systematic manner. Finally I show how we can\nstart to reconstruct the early history of core formation taking advantage of\nthe chemical changes in the gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2005 16:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Submitted to Journal of Optics B","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  A mere correspondence between the electron statistics and the photon one\nvanishes in the feedback loop (FBL). It means that the direct photodetection,\nsupplying us with the electron statistics, does not provide us with a wished\ninformation about the laser photon statistics. For getting this information we\nshould think up another measurement procedure, and we in the article suggest\napplying the three-level laser as a auxiliary measuring device. This laser has\nimpressive property, namely, its photon statistics survive information about\nthe initial photon statistics of the laser which excites coherently the\nthree-level medium. Thus, if we choose the laser in the FBL as exciting the\nthree-level laser, then we have an possibility to evaluate its initial photon\nstatistics by means of direct detecting the three-level laser emission.\nFinally, this approach allows us to conclude the feedback is not capable of\ncreating a regularity in the laser light beam. Contrary, the final photon\nfluctuations turn out to be always even bigger. The mentioned above feature of\nthe three-level laser takes place only for the strong interaction between the\nlasers (exciting and excited). It means the initial state of the exciting laser\nis changed dramatically, so our measurement procedure can not be identified\nwith some non-demolition one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2005 17:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
