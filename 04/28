We present the broad-band spectrum of the prompt emission,\nincluding optical, X- and gamma-rays, confirming the suggestion that the\nemission mechanisms at low and high frequencies must have different physical\norigins. In the framework of the standard fireball model, we discuss the X-ray\nafterglow observed by the NFIs and its hard X-ray emission up to 60 keV several\nhours after the burst, detected for about 20 ks by the PDS. Considering the\n2-10 keV and optical light curves, the 0.1-60 keV spectrum during the 20 ks in\nwhich the PDS signal was present and the 8.46 GHz upper limits, we find that\nthe multi-wavelength observations cannot be readily accommodated by basic\nafterglow models. While the temporal and spectral behavior of the optical\nafterglow is possibly explained by a synchrotron cooling frequency between the\noptical and the X-ray energy band during the NFIs observations, in X-rays this\nassumption only accounts for the slope of the 2-10 keV light curve, but not for\nthe flatness of the 0.1-60 keV spectrum. Including the contribution of Inverse\nCompton (IC) scattering, we solve the problem of the flat X-ray spectrum and\njustify the hard X-ray emission; we suggest that the lack of a significant\ndetection of 15-60 keV emission in the following 75 ks and last 70 ks spectra,\nshould be related to poorer statistics rather than to an important suppression\nof IC contribution. However, considering also the radio band data, we find the\n8.46 GHz upper limits violated.

The observed abundance ratios and their scatters\ntherefore have diagnostic power as regards the yields. The relatively small\nstar-to-star scatter observed in many chemical abundance ratios, e.g. by Cayrel\net al.

Thus, the measurements at these wavelengths\ncan be used to test the orientation-dependent unification model. As predicted\nby the model, the behavior of the sources is consistent with the presence of an\nobscuring circumnuclear torus; in fact, we find it may still have significant\noptical depth at 24 um.In addition, as expected for the radio-loud quasars,\nthere is a significant correlation between the low frequency radio (178 MHz)\nand the 70 um emission, two presumably isotropic indicators of nuclear\nactivity. This result is consistent with the simple unified scheme. However,\nthere is a population of radio galaxies that are underluminous at 70 um\ncompared with the radio-loud quasars and hence are a challenge to the simple\nunified model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2005 03:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The effective\nbehavior of a given microscopic model is calculated by solving coupled\ndifferential flow equations for the Green functions with an energy scale as the\nflow parameter. The symmetries of the microscopic model imply Ward identities\nbetween Green and response functions. It is shown that solutions of truncated\nflow-equation hierarchies satisfy Ward identities if the cutoff bare action is\ngauge invariant. However, truncations are generally not self-consistent\napproximations in the sense of Baym and Kadanoff.\n  The fRG is then applied to study Luttinger liquids. By computing the full\nspatial effective potential of a single impurity, long-range Friedel\noscillations are observed in the density profile with the expected power laws\nfor systems with up to 10^7 lattice sites. For a double barrier enclosing a dot\nregion we find temperature regimes in which the conductance follows power laws\nwith universal exponents, as well as non-universal crossover regimes in\nintermediate parameter regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2005 17:58:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The detectors in the network are still in their\ncommissioning phase and are expected to achieve their design sensitivity over\nthe next year or so. Each detector is a complex instrument involving many\nsubsystems and each subsystem is a source of noise at the output of the\ndetector. Therefore, in addition to recording the main gravitational wave data\nchannel at the output of the interferometer, the state of each detector\nsubsystem is monitored and recorded. This subsidiary data is both large in\nvolume as well as complex in nature. We require an online monitoring and\nanalysis tool which can process all the data channels for various noise\nartefacts and summarize the results of the analysis in a manner that can be\naccessed and interpreted conveniently.\n  In this paper we describe the GEO600 Online Detector Characterization System\n(GODCS), which is the tool that is being used to monitor the output of the\nGEO600 gravitational wave detector situated near Hannover in Germany. We\ndescribe the various algorithms that we use and how the results of several\nalgorithms can be combined to make meaningful statements about the state of the\ndetector.

The bulk\nof the material presented here is distilled from Atiyah's classic \"K-Theory\"\ntext, as well as his series of seminal papers \"The Index of Elliptic Operators\"\nwith Singer. Additional topics include equivariant K-theory, the G-index\ntheorem, and Bott's paper \"The Index Theorem for Homogeneous Differential\nOperators\". It also includes an appendix with a proof of Bott periodicity, as\nwell as sketches of proofs for both the standard and equivariant versions of\nthe K-theory Thom isomorphism theorem, in terms of the index for families of\nelliptic operators. A second appendix derives the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral\nsequence. This text originated as notes from a series of lectures given by the\nauthor as an undergraduate at Princeton. In its current form, the author has\nused it for graduate courses at the University of Oregon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2005 19:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, a recent STI clinical trial reported a high degree\nof virologic failure. Here we present a novel hypothesis that could explain\nvirologic failure to STI and provides new insights of great clinical relevance.\nWe analyze a classic mathematical model of HIV within-host viral dynamics and\nfind that nonlinear parametric resonance occurs when STI are added to the\nmodel; resonance is observed as virologic failure. We use the model to simulate\nclinical trial data and to calculate patient-specific resonant spectra. We gain\ntwo important insights. Firstly, within an STI trial, we determine that\npatients who begin with similar viral loads can be expected to show extremely\ndifferent virologic responses as a result of resonance. Thus, high\nheterogeneity of patient response within a STI clinical trial is to be\nexpected. Secondly and more importantly, we determine that virologic failure is\nnot simply due to STI or patient characteristics; rather it is the result of a\ncomplex dynamic interaction between STI and patient viral dynamics.
