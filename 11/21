To do so\nwe generalize the quadratic methods developed for the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) to 21 cm fluctuations. We show that the three dimensional\nsignal can be decomposed into a finite number of line of sight Fourier modes\nthat contribute to the lensing reconstruction. Our formalism properly takes\naccount of correlations along the line of sight and uses all the information\ncontained in quadratic combinations of the signal. In comparison with the CMB,\n21 cm fluctuations have the disadvantage of a relatively scale invariant\nunlensed power spectrum which suppresses the lensing effect. The smallness of\nthe lensing effect is compensated by using information from a range of observed\nredshifts. We estimate the size of experiments that are needed to measure this\neffect. With a square kilometer of collecting area and a maximal baseline of 3\nkm one can achieve lensing reconstruction noise levels an order of magnitude\nbelow CMB quadratic estimator constraints at L=1000, and map the deflection\nfield out to less then a tenth of a degree (L> 2000) within a season of\nobservations on one field. Statistical lensing power spectrum detections will\nbe possible to sub-arcminute scales, even with the limited sky coverage that\ncurrently conceived experiments have. One should be able to improve constraints\non cosmological parameters by using this method. With larger collecting areas\nor longer observing times, one could probe arcminute scales of the lensing\npotential and thus individual clusters.

We calculate the dispersion relation for small\noscillations of vortex positions (Tkachenko modes) in the mean-field quantum\nHall regime, taking into account the coupling of these modes with density\nexcitations. Using an analytic form for the density of the vortex lattice, we\nnumerically calculate the elastic constants for different lattice geometries.\nWe also apply this method to calculate the elastic constant for the\nsingle-component triangular lattice. For a two-component BEC, there are two\nkinds of Tkachenko modes, which we call acoustic and optical in analogy with\nphonons. For all lattice types, acoustic Tkachenko mode frequencies have\nquadratic wave-number dependence at long-wavelengths, while the optical\nTkachenko modes have linear dependence. For triangular lattices the dispersion\nof the Tkachenko modes are isotropic, while for other lattice types the\ndispersion relations show directional dependence consistent with the symmetry\nof the lattice. Depending on the intercomponent interaction there are five\ndistinct lattice types, and four structural phase transitions between them. Two\nof these transitions are second-order and are accompanied by the softening of\nan acoustic Tkachenko mode. The remaining two transitions are first-order and\nwhile one of them is accompanied by the softening of an optical mode, the other\ndoes not have any dramatic effect on the Tkachenko spectrum. We also find an\ninstability of the vortex lattice when the intercomponent repulsion becomes\nstronger than the repulsion within components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2005 11:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2006 12:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A way to adress this issue is to use additional phonetic\nconstraints. Knowledge of the phonetic caracteristics of French vowels enable\nthe derivation of reasonable articulatory domains in the space of Maeda\nparameters: given the formants frequencies (F1,F2,F3) of a speech sample, and\nthus the vowel identity, an \"ideal\" articulatory domain can be derived.

The present paper\nis devoted to a number of selected topics within this framework: Euclidean and\nrotation groups; the properties of fullerenes in physical chemistry; Galilei,\nLorentz and Poincare groups; conformal transformations and the Laplace\nequation; quantum groups and Sklyanin algebras. For example, graphite can be\nvaporized by laser irradiation, producing a remarkably stable cluster\nconsisting of 60 carbon atoms. The corresponding theoretical model considers a\ntruncated icosahedron, i.e. a polygon with 60 vertices and 32 faces, 12 of\nwhich are pentagonal and 20 hexagonal. The Carbon 60 molecule obtained when a\ncarbon atom is placed at each vertex of this structure has all valences\nsatisfied by two single bonds and one double bond. In other words, a structure\nin which a pentagon is completely surrounded by hexagons is stable. Thus, a\ncage in which all 12 pentagons are completely surrounded by hexagons has\noptimum stability. On a more formal side, the exactly solvable models of\nquantum and statistical physics can be studied with the help of the quantum\ninverse problem method. The problem of enumerating the discrete quantum systems\nwhich can be solved by the quantum inverse problem method reduces to the\nproblem of enumerating the operator-valued functions that satisfy an equation\ninvolving a fixed solution of the quantum Yang--Baxter equation. Two basic\nequations exist which provide a systematic procedure for obtaining completely\nintegrable lattice approximations to various continuous completely integrable\nsystems. This analysis leads in turn to the discovery of Sklyanin algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2005 08:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
