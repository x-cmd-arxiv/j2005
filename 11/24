Detailed morphological and spatially\nresolved spectral studies reveal the very-high-energy (VHE -- Energies E > 100\nGeV) gamma-ray aspects of this object with unprecedented precision. Since this\nis the first in-depth analysis of an extended VHE gamma-ray source, we present\na thorough discussion of our methodology and investigations of possible sources\nof systematic errors. Gamma rays are detected throughout the whole SNR. The\nemission is found to resemble a shell structure with increased fluxes from the\nwestern and northwestern parts. The differential gamma-ray spectrum of the\nwhole SNR is measured over more than two orders of magnitude, from 190 GeV to\n40 TeV, and is rather hard with indications for a deviation from a pure power\nlaw at high energies. Spectra have also been determined for spatially separated\nregions of RX J1713.7-3946. The flux values vary by more than a factor of two,\nbut no significant change in spectral shape is found.

We introduce the notion of Ramsey partitions of a finite metric\nspace, and show that the existence of good Ramsey partitions implies a solution\nto the metric Ramsey problem for large distortion (a.k.a. the non-linear\nversion of the isomorphic Dvoretzky theorem, as introduced by Bourgain, Figiel,\nand Milman). We then proceed to construct optimal Ramsey partitions, and use\nthem to show that for every e\\in (0,1), any n-point metric space has a subset\nof size n^{1-e} which embeds into Hilbert space with distortion O(1/e). This\nresult is best possible and improves part of the metric Ramsey theorem of\nBartal, Linial, Mendel and Naor, in addition to considerably simplifying its\nproof. We use our new Ramsey partitions to design the best known approximate\ndistance oracles when the distortion is large, closing a gap left open by\nThorup and Zwick. Namely, we show that for any $n$ point metric space X, and\nk>1, there exists an O(k)-approximate distance oracle whose storage requirement\nis O(n^{1+1/k}), and whose query time is a universal constant. We also discuss\napplications of Ramsey partitions to various other geometric data structure\nproblems, such as the design of efficient data structures for approximate\nranking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2005 20:06:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2005 06:35:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 May 2006 19:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-15"}

Due to light-induced two-body\ncollisions during the loading stage of the trap the maximum number of captured\natoms is locked to one. This collisional blockade effect is confirmed by the\nobservation of photon anti-bunching in the detected fluorescence light. The\nspectral properties of single photons emitted by the atom were studied with a\nnarrow-band scanning cavity. We find that the atomic fluorescence spectrum is\ndominated by the spectral width of the exciting laser light field. In addition\nwe observe a spectral broadening of the atomic fluorescence light due to the\nDoppler effect. This allows us to determine the mean kinetic energy of the\ntrapped atom corresponding to a temperature of 105 micro Kelvin. This simple\nsingle-atom trap is the key element for the generation of atom-photon\nentanglement required for future applications in quantum communication and a\nfirst loophole-free test of Bell's inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2005 13:26:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2006 11:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
