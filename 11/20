We\nare undertaking a photometric survey of all known galaxy-mass strong lenses to\ncharacterize their environments and include them in careful lens modeling, and\nto build a large, uniform sample of galaxy groups at intermediate redshifts for\nevolutionary studies. In this paper we present wide-field photometry of the\nenvironments of twelve lens systems with 0.24 < z_lens < 0.5. Using a\nred-sequence identifying technique, we find that eight of the twelve lenses lie\nin groups, and that ten group-like structures are projected along the line of\nsight towards seven of these lenses. Follow-up spectroscopy of a subset of\nthese fields confirms these results. For lenses in groups, the group centroid\nposition is consistent with the direction of the external tidal shear required\nby lens models. Lens galaxies are not all super-L_* ellipticals; the median\nlens luminosity is < L_*, and the distribution of lens luminosities extends 3\nmagnitudes below L_* (in agreement with theoretical models). Only two of the\nlenses in groups are the brightest group galaxy, in qualitative agreement with\ntheoretical predictions. As in the local Universe, the highest\nvelocity-dispersion groups contain a brightest member spatially coincident with\nthe group centroid, whereas lower-dispersion groups tend to have an offset\nbrightest group galaxy.

The substitution rate\nmatrix, that determines the Markov process, can be estimated using the\nexpectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Unfortunately, an exhaustive search\nfor the ML phylogenetic tree is computationally prohibitive for large data\nsets. In such situations, the neighbor-joining (NJ) method is frequently used\nbecause of its computational speed. The NJ method reconstructs trees by\nclustering neighboring sequences recursively, based on pairwise comparisons\nbetween the sequences. The NJ method can be generalized such that\nreconstruction is based on comparisons of subtrees rather than pairwise\ndistances.

Within this scenario we describe a STIRAP like process which allows to\nmove an atom between the ground states of two trapping potentials and analyze\nits robustness. This analogy is extended to other robust and coherent transport\nschemes and to systems of more than a single atom. Finally it is applied to\nmanipulate external degrees of freedom of atomic wave packets propagating in\nwaveguides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2005 14:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
