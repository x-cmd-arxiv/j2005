The number\ndensity of galaxy clusters is highly sensitive to cluster mass through\nfluctuations in the matter power spectrum, as well as redshift through the\ncomoving volume and the growth factor. This sensitivity in principle allows\ntight constraints on such quantities as the equation of state of dark energy\nand the neutrino mass. We evaluate the ability of future cluster surveys to\nmeasure these quantities simultaneously when combined with PLANCK-like CMB\ndata. Using a simple effective model for uncertainties in the cluster mass-SZ\nflux relation, we evaluate systematic shifts in cosmological constraints from\ncluster SZ surveys. We find that a systematic bias of 10% in cluster mass\nmeasurements can give rise to shifts in cosmological parameter estimates at\nlevels larger than the $1\\sigma$ statistical errors. Systematic errors are\nunlikely to be detected from the mass and redshift dependence of cluster number\ncounts alone; increasing survey size has only a marginal effect.

Such a neutrino can possess\nboth electric charge and vector dipole moment. Their form factors appear, for\nexample, at the polarized neutrino scattering in the field of a spinless\nnucleus. We derive an equation which relates the masses to a ratio of Dirac and\nPauli form factors of each lepton and its neutrino. A new left-right\nantisymmetric theory of force unification based on a gauge group $SU(2)_{L}$\n$\\otimes$ $SU(2)_{R}$ $\\otimes$ $U(1)$ is suggested. In this theory, the\nleptons and their neutrinos are united in families not only of the left-handed\n$SU(2)_{L}$-doublets, but also of the right-handed $SU(2)_{R}$-doublets.\nThereby, it predicts the existence in nature of the left (right) dileptons and\nparadileptons. A formation of any of them is responsible for the legality of\nconservation of charge, lepton flavors and full lepton number. Therefore, each\nof the earlier measured processes originated at the conservation both of summed\nelectric charge and of any lepton number may serve as the first confirmation of\na given theory in which the mass, charge and vector dipole moment of the\nneutrino are proportional, respectively, to the mass, charge and vector dipole\nmoment of a lepton of the same family.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2005 03:10:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 2006 04:57:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2013 02:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-08"}
