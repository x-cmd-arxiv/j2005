No emission is\ndetected at 3.5 cm continuum, with a 3 sigma upper limit of ~0.08 mJy. From\nthese values, we obtain a spectral index of ~2.5 in the 3.5 cm to 7 mm\nwavelength range, indicating that the observed flux density at 7mm is most\nlikely dominated by thermal dust emission coming from a circumstellar disc. We\nuse available photometric data from the literature to model the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of this object from radio to near-ultraviolet frequencies.\nThe observed SED can be understood in terms of an irradiated accretion disc\nwith low mass accretion rate, 10^{-8} solar masses per year, surrounding a star\nwith an age of ~10 Myr. We infer that the mass of the disc is ~0.04 solar\nmasses, and is populated by dust grains that have grown to a maximum size of 1\nmm everywhere, consistent with the lack of silicate emission at 10 microns.\nThese features, as well as indications of settling in the wall at the dust\ndestruction radius, led us to speculate the disc of HD169142 is in an advanced\nstage of dust evolution, particularly in its inner regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2005 12:52:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

This\nhas been tackled recently by characterizing the properties of its\nrepresentative graphs in which vertices and directed edges are identified with\nweb-pages and hyperlinks, respectively. Data gathered in large scale crawls\nhave been analyzed by several groups resulting in a general picture of the WWW\nthat encompasses many of the complex properties typical of rapidly evolving\nnetworks. In this paper, we report a detailed statistical analysis of the\ntopological properties of four different WWW graphs obtained with different\ncrawlers. We find that, despite the very large size of the samples, the\nstatistical measures characterizing these graphs differ quantitatively, and in\nsome cases qualitatively, depending on the domain analyzed and the crawl used\nfor gathering the data. This spurs the issue of the presence of sampling biases\nand structural differences of Web crawls that might induce properties not\nrepresentative of the actual global underlying graph. In order to provide a\nmore accurate characterization of the Web graph and identify observables which\nare clearly discriminating with respect to the sampling process, we study the\nbehavior of degree-degree correlation functions and the statistics of\nreciprocal connections. The latter appears to enclose the relevant correlations\nof the WWW graph and carry most of the topological information of theWeb. The\nanalysis of this quantity is also of major interest in relation to the\nnavigability and searchability of the Web.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2005 20:18:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2006 16:48:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-23"}

An area theorem for transmission over general memoryless channels\nis introduced and some of its many consequences are discussed.

The theory has global symmetries under torus actions\noriginated in space rotations and gauge symmetries. We investigate the\nSeiberg-Witten monopole equations reduced to 0 dimension and the fixed point\nequations of the torus actions. We show that the Dirac equation reduced to 0\ndimension is trivial when the fixed point equations and the ADHM equations are\nsatisfied.

The corresponding action satisfies two important\nproperties required for a proper treatment of semi-classical issues and, in\nparticular, to connect with any dual non-gravitational description of\nasymptotically flat space. These properties are that 1) the action is finite\non-shell and 2) asymptotically flat solutions are stationary points under {\\it\nall} variations preserving asymptotic flatness; i.e., not just under variations\nof compact support. Our definition of asymptotic flatness is sufficiently\ngeneral to allow the magentic part of the Weyl tensor to be of the same order\nas the electric part and thus, for d=4, to have non-vanishing NUT charge.\nDefinitive results are demonstrated when the boundary is either a cylindrical\nor a hyperbolic (i.e., de Sitter space) representation of spacelike infinity\n($i^0$), and partial results are provided for more general representations of\n$i^0$.

Two approaches\nhave long been used to estimate ratios of normalizing constants. The `simple\nimportance sampling' (SIS) or `free energy perturbation' method uses a sample\ndrawn from just one of the two distributions. The `bridge sampling' or\n`acceptance ratio' estimate can be viewed as the ratio of two SIS estimates\ninvolving a bridge distribution. For both methods, difficult problems must be\nhandled by introducing a sequence of intermediate distributions linking the two\ndistributions of interest, with the final ratio of normalizing constants being\nestimated by the product of estimates of ratios for adjacent distributions in\nthis sequence. Recently, work by Jarzynski, and independently by Neal, has\nshown how one can view such a product of estimates, each based on simple\nimportance sampling using a single point, as an SIS estimate on an extended\nstate space. This `Annealed Importance Sampling' (AIS) method produces an\nexactly unbiased estimate for the ratio of normalizing constants even when the\nMarkov transitions used do not reach equilibrium. In this paper, I show how a\ncorresponding `Linked Importance Sampling' (LIS) method can be constructed in\nwhich the estimates for individual ratios are similar to bridge sampling\nestimates. I show empirically that for some problems, LIS estimates are much\nmore accurate than AIS estimates found using the same computation time,\nalthough for other problems the two methods have similar performance.

We also briefly discuss the concept of\n\"space collapse or space destroyer\" by introducing a free space in between two\nbarriers covering the ring. Further we show in presence of absorption the\nreflection phase time exhibits Hartman effect in contrast to the transmission\nphase time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2005 13:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For\nnon-dissipative dynamics, by using the Schroedinger inequality instead of the\nHeisenberg-Robertson inequality, we obtain a general exact time-energy\nuncertainty relation which is sharper than the usual Mandelstam-Tamm-Messiah\nrelation $\\tau_F\\Delta_H\\ge \\hbar/2$. For simultaneous unitary/dissipative\ndynamics, the usual time-energy uncertainty relation is replaced by a less\nrestrictive relation that depends on the characteristic time of dissipation,\n$\\tau$, and the uncertainty associated with the generalized nonequilibrium\nMassieu-function operator which defines the structure of the dissipative part\nof the assumed class of evolution equations. Within the steepest-entropy-ascent\ndissipative quantum dynamics of an isolated system introduced earlier by this\nauthor, we obtain the interesting time-energy and time-entropy uncertainty\nrelation $(2\\tau_F\\Delta_H/ \\hbar)^2+ (\\tau_F\\Delta_S/k_B\\tau)^2 \\ge 1$. We\nillustrate this result and various other inequalities by means of numerical\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2005 14:24:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2005 09:01:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2006 13:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
