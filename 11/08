In particular, for late-type stars, some authors have proposed a\nwind model driven by an outward-directed flux of damped Alfven waves. The winds\nof these stars present great amounts of dust particles that, if charged, can\ngive rise to new wave modes or modify the pre-existing ones. In this work, we\nstudy how the dust can affect the propagation of Alfven waves in these winds\ntaking into account a specific damping mechanism, dust-cyclotron damping. This\ndamping affects the Alfven wave propagation near the dust-cyclotron frequency.\nHence, if we assume a dust size distribution, the damping occurs over a broad\nband of wave frequencies. In this work, we present a model of Alfven\nwave-driven winds using the dust-cyclotron damping mechanism. On the basis of\ncoronal holes in the Sun, which present a superradial expansion, our model also\nassumes a diverging geometry for the magnetic field. Thus, the mass, momentum,\nand energy equations are obtained and then solved in a self-consistent\napproach. Our results of wind velocity and temperature profiles for a typical\nK5 supergiant star shows compatibility with observations. We also show that,\nconsidering the presence of charged dust particles, the wave flux is less\ndamped due to the dust-cyclotron damping than it would be if we consider some\nother damping mechanisms studied in the literature, such as nonlinear damping,\nresonant surface damping, and turbulent damping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2005 18:09:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2006 20:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Here we explore the\nproduction of these nuclei in the neutrino-driven wind from a young neutron\nstar. We consider such early times that the wind still contains a proton excess\nbecause the rates for electron neutrino and positron captures on neutrons are\nfaster than those for the inverse captures on protons.

The investigation of the sensitivity of the flux at each wavelength to\nthe mass fraction of stars of different ages allows us to identify new\nage-sensitive features in galaxy spectra. We also highlight a fundamental\nlimitation in the recovery of the SF histories of galaxies for which the\noptical signatures of intermediate-age stars are masked by those of younger and\nolder stars. We apply this method to derive average SF histories from the\nhighest-quality spectra of morphologically identified early- and late-type\ngalaxies in the SDSS EDR [...].

There\nare three grain populations with different spatial distributions: (I) large\ngrains have the clumpy resonant distribution of the planetesimals; (II)\nmoderate sized grains are no longer in resonance and have an axisymmetric\ndistribution; (III) small grains are blown out of the system by radiation\npressure and have a distribution which falls off oc 1/r, however these grains\ncan be further divided into subclasses: (IIIa) grains produced from pop I that\nexhibit trailing spiral structure emanating from the clumps; and (IIIb) grains\nproduced from pop II that have an axisymmetric distribution. Since observations\nin different wavebands are sensitive to different sized dust grains,\nmulti-wavelength imaging can be used to test models for the origin of debris\ndisk structure. For example, a disk with no blow-out grains would appear clumpy\nin the sub-mm, but smooth at mid- to far-IR wavelengths. The wavelength of the\ntransition is indicative of the mass of the perturbing planet. The size\ndistribution of Vega's disk is modeled in the light of the recent Spitzer\nobservations. The origin of the large quantities of pop III grains seen by\nSpitzer must be in the destruction of the grains seen in the sub-mm, and so at\nhigh resolution and sensitivity the mid- to far-IR structure of Vega's disk is\npredicted to include spiral structure emanating from the sub-mm clumps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2005 13:12:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The cost of an LA is the sum of lengths of the edges of\nthe graph, where the length of an edge is defined as the absolute value of the\ndifference of the integers assigned to its ends. For many application one hopes\nto find an LA with small cost. However, it is a classical NP-complete problem\nto decide whether a given graph $G$ admits an LA of cost bounded by a given\ninteger. Since every edge of $G$ contributes at least one to the cost of any\nLA, the problem becomes trivially fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) if\nparameterized by the upper bound of the cost. Fernau asked whether the problem\nremains FPT if parameterized by the upper bound of the cost minus the number of\nedges of the given graph; thus whether the problem is FPT ``parameterized above\nguaranteed value.'' We answer this question positively by deriving an algorithm\nwhich decides in time $O(m+n+5.88^k)$ whether a given graph with $m$ edges and\n$n$ vertices admits an LA of cost at most $m+k$ (the algorithm computes such an\nLA if it exists).

Such statistical states can\nbe interpreted as fluctuations of the background field, cf. with SED and\nNelson's mechanics. Physical variables (e.g., energy) are given by maps $f:\n\\Omega \\to {\\bf R}$ (functions of classical fields). The conventional quantum\nrepresentation of our prequantum classical statistical model is constructed on\nthe basis of the Taylor expansion (up to the terms of the second order at the\nvacuum field point $\\psi\\_{\\rm{vacuum}}\\equiv 0)$ of variables $f: \\Omega \\to\n{\\bf R}$ with respect to the small parameter $\\sqrt{\\alpha}.$ The complex\nstructure of QM is induced by the symplectic structure on the\ninfinite-dimensional phase space $\\Omega.$ A Gaussian measure (statistical\nstate) is represented in QM by its covariation operator. Equations of\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger, Heisenberg and von Neumann are images of Hamiltonian dynamics\non $\\Omega.$ The main experimental prediction of our prequantum model is that\nexperimental statistical averages can deviate from ones given by QM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2005 12:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
