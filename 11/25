We find that instability boundaries first obtained\nin numerical studies can be explained by overlap between sub-resonances within\nmean-motion resonances (mostly of the j:1 type). Strong secular forcing from\nthe companion displaces the centroids of different sub-resonances, producing\nlarge regions of resonance overlap. Planets lying within these overlapping\nregions experience chaotic diffusion, which in most cases leads to their\neventual ejection. The overlap region extends to shorter-period orbits as\neither the companion's mass or its eccentricity increase. Our analytical\ncalculations reproduce the instability boundaries observed in numerical studies\nand yield the following two additional results. Firstly, the instability\nboundary as a function of eccentricity is jagged; thus, the widest stable orbit\ncould be reduced from previously quoted values by as much as 20%. Secondly,\nvery high order resonances (e.g., 50:3) do not significantly modify the\ninstability boundary despite the fact that these weak resonances can produce\nslow chaotic diffusion which may be missed by finite-duration numerical\nintegrations. We present some numerical evidence for the first result. More\nextensive experiments are called for to confirm these conclusions. For the\nspecial case of circular binaries, we find that the Hill criterion (based on\nthe critical Jacobi integral) yields an instability boundary that is very\nsimilar to that obtained by resonance overlap arguments, making the former both\na necessary and a sufficient condition for planet instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2005 19:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This is done by allowing the valence orbitals to relax within a\nself-consistent field (SCF) calculation. The diagonal matrix element of the\nHamiltonian leads to a shift of the center of gravity of the conduction band\nwhile the off-diagonal matrix elements result in a small reduction of the\nconduction-electron band width.

Ordinary finite energy sum rules\n(FESR) exhibit poor saturation up to energies below the tau-lepton mass. A\nremarkable improvement is achieved by introducing pinched, as well as\nminimizing polynomial integral kernels. Both methods are used to determine the\ndimension d=6 and d=8 vacuum condensates in the Operator Product Expansion,\nwith the results: {O}_{6}=-(0.00226 \\pm 0.00055) GeV^6, and O_8=-(0.0053 \\pm\n0.0033) GeV^8 from pinched FESR, and compatible values from the minimizing\npolynomial FESR.

We suggest the existence of strongly bound\ncrypto-exotic baryons, which contain a charm-anti-charm pair. Such states are\nnarrow since they can decay only via OZI-violating processes. A narrow nucleon\nresonance is found at mass 3.52 GeV. It is a coupled-channel bound state of the\n$(\\eta_c N), (\\bar D \\Sigma_c)$ system, which decays dominantly into the\n$(\\eta' N)$ channel.

Most striking is the small width of about 1\nMeV of the lower state. The upper state may be significantly broader due to a\nstrong coupling to the $(\\eta' \\Lambda)$ state.

These\ndetectors are superior MCPs due to the very low rate of noise pulses and thus\ndue to the high signal to noise ratio. Other important features of these\ndetectors are that they have excellent position resolutions - 30 micron in\ndigital form, are vibration stable and are spark protected.

We explore this question using an agent-based model inspired by the\nfission-fusion society of Spider monkeys (Ateles spp). Our model introduces a\nrealistic, complex foraging environment composed of many resource patches with\nsize varying according to an inverse power-law frequency distribution with\nexponent $\\beta$. Foragers do not interact among them and start from random\ninitial locations. They have either a complete or partial knowledge of the\nenvironment and maximize the ratio between the size of the next visited patch\nand the distance traveled to it, ignoring previously visited patches. At\nintermediate values of $\\beta$, when large patches are neither too scarce nor\ntoo abundant, foragers form groups (coincide at the same patch) with a similar\nsize frequency distribution as the spider monkey's subgroups. Fission-fusion\nevents create a network of associations that contains weak bonds among foragers\nthat meet only rarely and strong bonds among those that repeat associations\nmore frequently than would be expected by chance. The latter form sub-networks\nwith the highest number of bonds and a high clustering coefficient at\nintermediate values of $\\beta$. The weak bonds enable the whole social network\nto percolate. Some of our results are similar to those found in long-term field\nstudies of spider monkeys and other fission-fusion species.
