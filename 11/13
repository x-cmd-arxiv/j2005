Boundary conditions corresponding to a return to\nthe upstream temperature ($R$ = 1) and to a cold wall ($R$ = 0) are\ninvestigated. We find that for Mach number $M > 5$, the strong shock\noverstability limits are not significantly modified. For $M < 3$, however,\nshocks are considerably more stable for most cases. In general, as the shock\nweakens, the critical values of the temperature power-law index (below which\nshocks are overstable) are reduced for the overtones more than for the\nfundamental, which signifies a change in basic behaviour. In the $R$ = 0\nscenario, however, we find that the overstability regime and growth rate of the\nfundamental mode are increased when cooling is under local thermodynamic\nequilibrium.

We\nmodel the change in lactate production which occurs when the MAP kinase pathway\nis activated, using a non-equilibrium, chemical-kinetic model of homolactic\nfermentation. In particular, we examine the role of LDH isoforms, which\ncatalyze the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Changes in the isoform ratio\nare not the primary determinant of the production of lactate.

We investigate quantitatively control protocols\nbased on purely deterministic, purely random, as well as hybrid design, and\nidentify their relative merits and weaknesses at improving system performance.\nWe find that for time-independent systems, hybrid protocols tend to perform\nbetter than pure random and may improve over standard asymmetric schemes,\nwhereas random protocols can be considerably more stable against fluctuations\nin the system parameters.
