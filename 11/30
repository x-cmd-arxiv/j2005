We make significant progress towards\nelucidating details of this topic by studying, via large-scale atomistic\nsimulations, liquid nanodroplets spreading on chemically patterned surfaces. A\nmodel is presented for lines of polymer liquid (droplets) on substrates\nconsisting of alternating strips of wetting (equilibrium contact angle\napproximately 0 degrees) and non-wetting (equilibrium contact angle\napproximately 90 degrees) material. Droplet spreading is compared for different\nwavelength of the pattern and strength of surface interaction on the wetting\nstrips. For small wavelength, droplets partially spread on both the wetting and\nnon-wetting regions of the substrate to attain a finite contact angle less than\n90 degrees. In this case, the extent of spreading depends on the interaction\nstrength in the wetting regions. A transition is observed such that, for large\nwavelength, the droplet spreads only on the wetting region of the substrate by\npulling material from non-wetting regions.

The characteristic\nfunction which determines the dynamics of such systems is the current-phase\nrelation Is(phi), which gives the relationship between the superfluid current\nIs flowing through a weak link and the quantum phase difference phi across it.\nHere we report the measurement of the current-phase relation of a superfluid\n4He weak link formed by an array of nano-apertures separating two reservoirs of\nsuperfluid 4He. As we vary the coupling strength between the two reservoirs, we\nobserve a transition from a strongly coupled regime in which Is(phi) is linear\nand flow is limited by 2pi phase slips, to a weak coupling regime where Is(phi)\nbecomes the sinusoidal signature of a Josephson weak link.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2005 01:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

This\ncomprises the measurement of the Higgs boson mass, its couplings to SM fermions\nand gauge bosons, and the determination of the spin and the CP quantum numbers\nof the Higgs. The extensions of the SM that are analyzed in more detail are\nheavy SM-like Higgs bosons, heavy Higgs bosons in the framework of\nSupersymmetry (SUSY) and further exotic scenarios. We review recent theoretical\ndevelopments in the field of Higgs boson physics. The important question what\nthe ILC can contribute to Higgs boson physics after the LHC, the LHC/ILC\ninterplay and synergy is discussed. The impact of Higgs boson physics on\ncosmology in several SUSY frameworks is analyzed. The impact of the accelerator\nand dector performance on the precision of measurements are discussed in\ndetail. We propose a strategy to optimize future analyses. Open questions\narising for the various topics are listed, further topics of study and\ncorresponding roadmaps are suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2005 19:48:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2006 20:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-15"}

A combined effect of the inertial\ninteractions and the molecule Brownian diffusivities is found to be the\nbi-fractal mechanism behind multifractal scaling in the inertial range of\nscales of moderate Reynolds number turbulence. Accordingly, a stochastic\nequation is proposed to describe turbulence intermittency. The 2/3-order\nfractional Laplacian representation is also used to construct a fractional\nReynolds equation for nonlinear interactions of fluctuating velocity\ncomponents, underlying turbulence spacetime fractal structures of Levy 2/3\nstable distribution. The new perspective of this study is that the fractional\ncalculus is an effective approach modeling of chaotic fractal phenomena induced\nby nonlinear interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2005 05:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is most interesting for us\nto show that, a photon inside a waveguide can be localized in the same sense\nthat a massive particle can be localized in free space, and just as that it is\nimpossible to localize a massive particle with a greater precision than its\nCompton wavelength, one can also arrival at a similar conclusion: it is\nimpossible to localize a photon inside a waveguide with a greater precision\nthan its equivalent Compton wavelength, which owing to evanescent-wave or\nphoton-tunneling phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2005 12:11:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Extending observations\nof Vaccaro et al., I argue that the free energy of a quantum system with\nG-invariant Hamiltonian then splits up into the Holevo information of the orbit\nof the state under the action of G and the free energy of its orbit average.\nThese two kinds of free energy cannot be converted into each other. The first\ncomponent is subadditive and the second superadditive; in the limit of\ninfinitely many copies only the usual free energy matters.\n  Refined splittings of free energy into more than two independent\n(non-increasing) terms can be defined by averaging over probability measures on\nG that differ from the Haar measure.\n  Even in the presence of a reference frame, these results provide lower bounds\non the amount of free energy that is lost after applying a covariant channel.\nIf the channel properly decreases one of these quantities, it decreases the\nfree energy necessarily at least by the same amount, since it is unable to\nconvert the different forms of free energies into each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2005 13:39:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
