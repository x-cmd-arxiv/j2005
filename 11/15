The\noptical depth within the torus is computed in detail taking into account the\ndifferent sublimation temperatures of the silicate and graphite grains, which\nsolves previously reported inconsistencies in the silicate emission feature in\ntype-1 AGN. We exploit this model to study the spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of 58 extragalactic (both type-1 and type-2) sources using archival\noptical and infrared (IR) data. We find that both AGN and starburst\ncontributions are often required to reproduce the observed SEDs, although in a\nfew cases they are very well fitted by a pure AGN component. The AGN\ncontribution to the far-IR luminosity is found to be higher in type-1 sources,\nwith all the type-2 requiring a substantial contribution from a circum-nuclear\nstarburst. Our results appear in agreement with the AGN Unified Scheme, since\nthe distributions of key parameters of the torus models turn out to be\ncompatible for type-1 and type-2 AGN. Further support to the unification\nconcept comes from comparison with medium-resolution IR spectra of type-1 AGN\nby the Spitzer observatory, showing evidence for a moderate silicate emission\naround 10 \\mums which our code reproduces. From our analysis we infer accretion\nflows in the inner nucleus of local AGN characterized by high equatorial\noptical depths ($A_V\\simeq 100$), moderate sizes ($R_{max}<100 pc$) and very\nhigh covering factors ($f\\simeq 80$ per cent) on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2005 07:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Some fundamental issues regarding time\ntranslation and phase space measure are clarified. In particular, we emphasize\nthat a phase space measure should be defined by means of the Jacobian of the\ntransformation between different types of coordinates since such a determinant\nis different from zero in the non-canonical case even if the phase space\ncompressibility is null. Instead, the Jacobian determinant associated with\nphase space flows is unity whenever non-canonical coordinates lead to a\nvanishing compressibility, so that its use in order to define a measure may not\nbe always correct. To better illustrate this point, we derive a mathematical\ncondition for defining non-Hamiltonian phase space flows with zero\ncompressibility. The Jacobian determinant associated with time evolution in\nphase space is altogether useful for analyzing time translation invariance. The\nproper definition of a phase space measure is particularly important when\ndefining the entropy functional in the canonical, non-canonical, and\nnon-Hamiltonian cases. We show how the use of relative entropies can circumvent\nsome subtle problems that are encountered when dealing with continuous\nprobability distributions and phase space measures.

This general scenario is\nillustrated here by focusing on a quantum dot coupled to a chaotic cavity\ncontaining a finite, but large, number of states using a Hamiltonian\nformulation. For weak coupling to a chaotic cavity with a sufficiently dense\nspectrum, the ensuing complex structure of resonances and antiresonances leads\nto phase randomization under coarse graining in energy. Such phase\ninstabilities and coarse graining are the ingredients for a mechanism producing\ndecoherence and thus irreversibility. For the present simple model one finds a\nconductance that coincides with the one obtained by adding a ficticious voltage\nprobe within the Landauer-Buettiker picture.

In this analysis we explicitly take into account the energy\nand momentum constraints as well as possible algebraic constraints on the\nevolution of high-frequency perturbations of solutions of Einstein's equations.\nIn this respect, our approach is principally different from standard analyses\nof well-posedness of free evolution in general relativity. Our study reveals\nthe existence of subsets of the linearized Einstein's equations that control\nthe well-posedness of constrained evolution. It is demonstrated that the\nwell-posedness of ADM, BSSN and other 3+1 formulations derived from ADM by\nadding combinations of constraints to the right-hand-side of ADM and/or by\nlinear transformation of the dynamical ADM variables depends entirely on the\nproperties of the gauge.

There are several\nshort-baseline reactor experiment projects with different fractions of air and\nearth matter along the neutrino path. Moreover, the short baselines, in\nprinciple, allow the physical change of the material between source and\ndetector. Hence, such experiments offer the possibility for a direct comparison\nof oscillations in air and matter. We demonstrate that for $\\sin^2 2\n\\theta_{13} \\gtrsim 0.04$, two reactor experiments (one air, one matter) with\nbaselines of at least 1.5 km can constrain any oscillation effect which is\ndifferent in air and matter at the level of a few per cent. Furthermore, we\nfind that using the same experiment while physically moving the material\nbetween source and detector improves systematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2005 21:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Such production models\nnaturally exhibit two time scales: a short one, characteristic of single items\nprocessed through individual machines, and a longer one, characteristic of the\nresponse time of the entire factory. Coarse-grained partial differential\nequations for the spatio-temporal evolution of a \"phase density\" were obtained\nthrough a kinetic theory approach in Armbruster et al. [2].

The key step in this process is lifting: the construction of\nfine-scale, discrete realizations consistent with a given coarse-grained phase\ndensity field.

Using the expression data of the\nnormal tissues we identified 4346 genes with a high variability of expression,\nand clustered these genes according to their relative expression level. Of 91\nstable clusters obtained, 24 clusters included genes preferentially expressed\neither only in hematopoietic tissues or in hematopoietic and 1-2 other tissues;\n28 clusters included genes preferentially expressed in various\nnon-hematopoietic tissues such as neuronal, testis, liver, kidney, muscle,\nlung, pancreas and placenta. Analysis of the expression levels of these 2\ngroups of genes in the human cancer cell lines and leukemias, identified genes\nthat were highly expressed in cancer cells but not in their normal\ncounterparts, and were thus over expressed in the cancers. The different cancer\ncell lines and leukemias varied in the number and identity of these over\nexpressed genes. The results indicate that many genes that are over expressed\nin human cancer cells are specific to a variety of normal tissues, including\nnormal tissues other than those from which the cancer originated.
