These objects have luminosities and redshifts characteristic of\nthe sources that produce the bulk of the QSO luminosity in the universe. Our\nfollow up observations in the submillimetre show that these QSOs are embedded\nin ultraluminous starburst galaxies, unlike most unabsorbed QSOs at the same\nredshifts and luminosities. The radically different star formation properties\nbetween the absorbed and unabsorbed QSOs implies that the X-ray absorption is\nunrelated to the torus invoked in AGN unification schemes. The most puzzling\nquestion about these objects is the nature of the X-ray absorber. We present\nour study of the X-ray absorbers based on deep (50-100ks) XMM-Newton\nspectroscopy. The hypothesis of a normal QSO continuum, coupled with a neutral\nabsorber is strongly rejected. We consider the alternative hypotheses for the\nabsorber, originating either in the QSO or in the surrounding starburst.\nFinally we discuss the implications for QSO/host galaxy formation, in terms of\nan evolutionary sequence of star formation and black hole growth. We propose\nthat both processes occur simultaneously in the gas-and-dust-rich heavily\nobscured centres of young galaxies, and that absorbed QSOs form a transitional\nstage, between the main obscured growth phase, and the luminous QSO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2005 20:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This features multiplicativity versus complete\nmultiplicativity of number theoretic arithmetic functions. The deficiency of\nnot being a Hopf algebra is then cured by introducing an `unrenormalized'\ncoproduct and an `unrenormalized' pairing.

We prove analogous results for groups quasi-isometric to $R\n\\ltimes R^n$ where the semidirect product is defined by a diagonalizable matrix\nof determinant one with no eigenvalues on the unit circle. Our approach to\nthese problems is to first classify all self quasi-isometries of the solvable\nLie group. Our classification of self quasi-isometries for $R \\ltimes \\R^n$\nproves a conjecture made by Farb and Mosher in [FM4].\n  Our techniques for studying quasi-isometries extend to some other classes of\ngroups and spaces. In particular, we characterize groups quasi-isometric to any\nlamplighter group, answering a question of de la Harpe [dlH].
