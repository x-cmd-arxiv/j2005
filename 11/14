The remaining two radius-expansion bursts reached peak\nfluxes a factor of 1.69+/-0.13 lower than this mean value; as a consequence,\nthe overall variation in the peak flux of the radius-expansion bursts was a\nfactor of ~2. This variation is comparable to the range of the Eddington limit\nbetween material with solar H-fraction (X=0.7) and pure He. Such a variation\nmay arise if, for the bright radius-expansion bursts, most of the accreted H is\neliminated either by steady hot CNO burning or expelled in a radiatively-driven\nwind. However, steady burning cannot exhaust the accreted H for solar\ncomposition material within the typical ~2 hr burst recurrence time, nor can it\nresult in sufficient elemental stratification to allow selective ejection of\nthe H only. An additional stratification mechanism appears to be required to\nseparate the accreted elements and thus allow preferential ejection of the\nhydrogen.
