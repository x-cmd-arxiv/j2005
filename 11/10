The intervening electrons in\nforeground galaxy clusters inversely Compton scatter the 21-cm background\nspectrum and modify it just as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum\nis modified by inverse-Compton scattering. Towards typical galaxy clusters at\nlow redshifts, the resulting modification is a few tenths milli-Kelvin\ncorrection to the few tens milli-Kelvin temperature of 21-cm signal relative to\nthat of the cosmic microwave background black body spectrum. The modifications\nare mostly associated with sharp changes in the cosmic 21-cm background\nspectrum such as due to the onset of a Lyman-$\\alpha$ radiation field or\nheating of neutral gas. Though low frequency radio interferometers that are now\nplanned for 21-cm anisotropy measurements are insensitive to the mean 21-cm\nspectrum, differential observations of galaxy clusters with these\ninterferometers can be utilized to indirectly establish global features in the\n21-cm frequency spectrum.

The most popular progenitor model invokes the merger of either double\nneutron star (DNS) binaries or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) systems. Such\nevents are strong sources of gravitational-waves (GWs) and might be detected by\nground-based GW observatories. In this work we combine the census of SHB\nobservations with refined theoretical analysis to perform a critical evaluation\nof the compact binary model. We then explore the implications for GW detection\nof these events. Beginning from the measured star-formation rate through cosmic\ntime, we consider what intrinsic luminosity and lifetime distributions can\nreproduce the known SHB redshifts and luminosities as well as the peak flux\ndistribution of the large BATSE SHB sample. We find that: (1) The typical\nprogenitor lifetime is long. Assuming lognormal lifetime distribution the\ntypical lifetime is >4[1] Gyr (2[3]\\sigma c.l.). If the lifetime distribution\nis a power-law with index \\eta then \\eta>-0.5 [-1] (2[3] \\sigma c.l.). This\nresult is difficult to reconcile with the properties of the observed galactic\nDNS population, suggesting that if SHBs do result from DNS mergers then the\nobserved galactic binaries do not represent the cosmic one. (2) We find that\nthe local rate of SHBs is larger than 10Gpc^-3/yr and may be higher by several\norders of magnitude, significantly above previous estimates. (3) Assuming that\nSHBs do result from compact binaries, our predictions for the LIGO and VIRGO\nevent rates are encouraging: The chance for detection by current facilities is\nnot negligible, while a coincident detection of GW and electromagnetic\nradiation from an SHB is guaranteed for next-generation observatories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2005 20:53:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2006 05:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We compare these results with the afterglow predictions of the high\nredshift scenario, where XRFs are GRBs at higher redshift and of the off-axis\nscenario, where the observed differences are due to viewing angle effects. In\nthis last framework, we consider jets with a homogeneous, a -2 power-law shaped\nand a Gaussian luminosity angular distribution.\n  We find that the high redshift scenario can explain some events but not the\ntotal sample of XRRs/XRFs.

Here we interpret this rich phenomenology within a new model of the\ndisk-magnetosphere interaction. Our model, based on the simplest version of a\npurely material torque, accounts for the fact that, when a neutron star is in\nthe propeller regime, a fraction of the ejected material does not receive\nenough energy to completely unbind, and hence falls back into the disk. We show\nthat the presence of this feedback mass component causes the occurrence of\nmultiple states available to the system, for a given, constant value of the\nmass accretion rate dot{M}_* from the companion star. If the angle chi of the\nmagnetic dipole axis with respect to the perpendicular to the disk is larger\nthan a critical value chi_crit, the system eventually settles in a cycle of\nspin-up/spin-down transitions for a constant value of dot{M}_* and independent\nof the initial conditions.

We are\nable to identify differential operators that still have an undeformed Leibniz\nrule and can therefore be gauged much in the same way as in the canonical case.\nBy linking these derivations to frames (vielbeins) of a curved manifold, it is\npossible to formulate noncommutative gauge theories that admit nonconstant\nnoncommutativity and go to gauge theory on curved spacetime in the commutative\nlimit. We are also able to express the dependence of the noncommutative\nquantities on their corresponding commutative counterparts by using\nSeiberg-Witten maps. In the second part we study noncommutative gauge theory in\nthe matrix theory approach. There, the noncommutative space is a finite\ndimensional matrix algebra (fuzzy space) which emerges as the ground state of a\nmatrix action, the fluctuations around this ground state creating the gauge\ntheory. This gauge theory is finite, goes to gauge theory on a 4-dimensional\nmanifold in the commutative limit and can also be used to regularize the\nnoncommutative gauge theory of the canonical case. In particular, we are able\nto match parts of the known instanton sector of the canonical case with the\ninstantons of the finite theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2005 14:36:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2005 15:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

By considering equal positive and negative\nlevels of return, we reported in [2,3] on a quantitative gain/loss asymmetry\nmost pronounced for short horizons.

The most\nreasonable explanation for this fact is that the gain/loss asymmetry observed\nin the DJIA as well as in the SP500 and Nasdaq are due to movements in the\nmarket as a whole, {\\it i.e.}, cooperative cascade processes (or\n``synchronization'') which disappear in the inverse statistics of the\nindividual stocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2005 12:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}
