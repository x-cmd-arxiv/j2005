The\nhigh probability is caused by some combination of a large Einstein angle, fast\nangular motion, and a dense background field. We refer to high-probability\nlenses as mesolenses. The mesolensing regime is complementary to the regime in\nwhich the optical depth is high, in that it applies to isolated lenses instead\nof to dense lens fields. Mesolensing is complementary to microlensing, because\nit is well suited to the study of different lens populations, and also because\ndifferent observing and analysis strategies are required to optimize the\ndiscovery and study of mesolenses. Planetary and stellar masses located within\n1-2 kpc are examples of mesolenses. We show that their presence can be detected\nagainst a wide variety of background fields, using distinctive signatures of\nboth time variability and spatial effects. Time signatures can be identical to\nthose of microlensing, but can also include baseline jitter, extreme apparent\nchromaticity, events well fit by lens models in which several independent\nsources are simultaneously lensed, and sequences of events.

We analyze two forms of dark energy sectors: the\ncosmological constant and phantom field. We find a simple exact solution of the\nmodels in which energy transfer is described by a Cardassian like term in the\nrelation of $H^{2}(z)$, where $H$ is Hubble's function and $z$ is redshift. The\nconsidered models have two additional parameters $(\\Omega_{\\text{int}},n)$\n(apart the parameters of the $\\Lambda$CDM model) which can be tested using SNIa\ndata. In the estimation of the model parameters Riess et al.'s sample is used.\nWe also confront the quality of statistical fits for both the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel and the interacting models with the help of the Akaike and Bayesian\ninformative criteria. Our conclusion from standard best fit method is that the\ninteracting models explains the acceleration of the Universe better but they\ngive rise to a universe with high matter density. However, using the tools of\ninformation criteria we find that the two new parameters play an insufficient\nrole in improving the fit to SNIa data and the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model is\nstill preferred. We conclude that high precision detection of high redshift\nsupernovae could supply data capable of justifying adoption of new parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2005 15:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We performed N-body simulation of the orbital\nevolution of a self-consistent satellite galaxy within a self-consistent parent\ngalaxy. We found that the orbital decay of the simulated satellite is\nsignificantly faster than the estimate from the dynamical friction formula. The\nmain cause of this discrepancy is that the stars stripped out of the satellite\nare still close to the satellite, and increase the drag force on the satellite\nthrough two mechanisms. One is the direct drag force from particles in the\ntrailing tidal arm, a non-axisymmetric force that slows the satellite down. The\nother is the indirect effect that is caused by the particles remaining close to\nthe satellite after escape. The force from them enhances the wake caused in the\nparent galaxy by dynamical friction, and this larger wake in turn slows the\nsatellite down more than expected from the contribution of its bound mass.

We demonstrate its efficacy regarding the trade-off\nbetween the expected number of nodes that receive the vaccine and the network's\nresulting vulnerability to develop an epidemic as the virus or worm attempts to\ninfect one of its nodes.

It is not integrable for any\nother zero-order solution. In the standard application of a Normal Form\nexpansion, integrability is recovered if, from second order onwards, the\nperturbation obeys algebraic constraints. In general, these are not satisfied.\nAs a result, the Normal Form is not asymptotically integrable; its solution,\nthe zero-order approximation, loses the simple structure of the solution of the\nunperturbed equation. This work exploits the freedom in the perturbative\nexpansion to propose an alternative, for which the loss of integrability only\naffects higher-order terms in the expansion of the solution. The Normal Form\nremains asymptotically integrable, and the zero-order approximation, not\naffected by the loss of integrability, has the same structure as the solution\nof the unperturbed equation. In the case of a multiple-soliton zero-order\napproximation, the loss of integrability affects the higher-order corrections\nto the solution in a finite domain around the origin in the x-t plane, the\nsoliton interaction region. The effect decays exponentially in all directions\nin the plane as the distance from the origin grows.

It has been shown that PrP106-126 can reproduce\nthe main neuropathological features of prionrelated transmissible spongiform\nencephalopathies and can form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. The conformational\ncharacteristics of PrP106-126 fibril have been investigated by electron\nmicroscopy, CD spectroscopy, NMR and molecular dynamics simulations. Recent\nresearches have found out that PrP106-126 in water assumes a stable structure\nconsisting of two parallel beta-sheets that are tightly packed against each\nother. In this work we perform molecular dynamics simulation to reveal the\nelongation mechanism of PrP106-126 fibril. Influenced by the edge strands of\nthe fibril which already adopt beta-sheets conformation, single PrP106-126\npeptide forms beta-structure and becomes a new element of the fibril. Under\nacidic condition, single PrP106-126 peptide adopts a much larger variety of\nconformations than it does under neural condition, which makes a peptide easier\nto be influenced by the edge strands of the fibril. However, acidic condition\ndose not largely affect the stability of PrP106-126 peptide fibril. Thus, the\nspeed of fibril elongation can be dramatically increased by lowering the pH\nvalue of the solution. The pH value was adjusted by either changing the\nprotonation state of the residues or adding hydronium ions (acidic solution) or\nhydroxyl ions (alkaline solution). The differences between these two approaches\nare analyzed here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2005 02:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
