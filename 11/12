This presents a\nchallenge for models of galaxy formation because massive halos are assembled\nlate in hierarchical cosmologies such as cold dark matter (CDM). In this paper,\nwe discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model in which\nfeedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows\nin massive halos. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy\nluminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the\nMillennium N-body simulation; the accurate dark matter merger trees and large\nnumber of realizations of the galaxy formation process that the simulation\nprovides results in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of\nthe physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of local\ngalaxies, we use it to investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and\ngalaxy stellar mass functions. We also calculate the volume averaged star\nformation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in\nwhich this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model\nrobustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift\n$z\\sim 5$ and a star formation rate density which rises with increasing\nredshift in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these\nproperties have been cited as evidence for ``anti-hierarchical'' galaxy\nformation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the\nfundamentally hierachical CDM model provides a very good match to these\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2005 18:19:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2006 11:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Among\nother items, the low-mode models exhibit final iron-group velocities of up to\n3300 km/s, strong mixing at the He/H composition interface, with hydrogen being\nmixed downward in velocity space to only 500 km/s, and a final prolate\nanisotropy of the ejecta with a major to minor axis ratio of about 1.6. The\nsuccess of low-mode explosions with an energy of about 2x10**51 erg to\nreproduce these observed features is based on two effects: the (by 40%) larger\ninitial maximum velocities of metal-rich clumps compared to our high-mode\nmodels, and the initial global deformation of the shock.
