Does there exist an analogue of this result in contact geometry? Our\nmain finding is that the answer depends on the sizes of the domains in\nquestion: We establish contact non-squeezing on large scales, and show that it\ndisappears on small scales. The algebraic counterpart of the (non)-squeezing\nproblem for contact domains is the question of existence of a natural partial\norder on the universal cover of the contactomorphisms group of a contact\nmanifold. In contrast to our earlier beliefs, we show that the answer to this\nquestion is very sensitive to the topology of the manifold. For instance, we\nprove that the standard contact sphere is non-orderable while the real\nprojective space is known to be orderable. Our methods include a new embedding\ntechnique in contact geometry as well as a generalized Floer homology theory\nwhich contains both cylindrical contact homology and Hamiltonian Floer\nhomology.

What is called a\n\"Telescope-Interferometer\" (T-I) is indeed a novel, recently proposed Wavefront\nError (WFE) sensing technique, whose basic idea consists in combining the main\npupil of a telescope with a second, off-axis reference arm. Then a weak\nmodulation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) is generated at the focal plane,\nallowing for direct phase measurements. We propose a notable improvement of the\nmethod, inspired from classical principles of phase shifting interferometry.\nHerein are presented the alternative principle and its achievable measurement\naccuracy. The technique shows high performance excepted on narrow areas located\nnear the pupil boundary. It is applicable to both ground or space telescopes\nand is suitable for the co-phasing of segmented mirrors, which is of prime\nimportance in view of future giant telescope projects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2005 15:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-19"}
