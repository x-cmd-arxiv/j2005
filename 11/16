The cross-field velocity\nsolution accounts for the changes of the vertical magnetic field seen between a\npair of successive active-region vector magnetograms via the ideal induction\nequation. The field-aligned velocity is obtained using the Doppler velocity and\nthe calculated cross-field velocity. Solving the ideal induction equation in\nvector magnetograms measured at a given altitude in the solar atmosphere is an\nunder-determined problem. In response, our general formalism allows the use of\nany additional constraint for the inductive cross-field velocity to enforce a\nunique solution in the induction equation. As a result, our methodology can\ngive rise to new velocity solutions besides the one presented here. To\nconstrain the induction equation, we use a special case of the minimum\nstructure approximation that was introduced in previous studies and is already\nemployed here to resolve the $180^o$-ambiguity in the input vector\nmagnetograms.

As a result, an array of scaling and multi-scaling\nimage-processing techniques can be used to measure the expected\nself-organization of solar magnetic fields. While these techniques advance our\nunderstanding of the physical system at work, it is unclear whether they can be\nused to predict solar eruptions, thus obtaining a practical significance for\nspace weather. We address part of this problem by focusing on solar active\nregions and by investigating the usefulness of scaling and multi-scaling\nimage-processing techniques in solar flare prediction. Since solar flares\nexhibit spatial and temporal intermittency, we suggest that they are the\nproducts of instabilities subject to a critical threshold in a turbulent\nmagnetic configuration. The identification of this threshold in scaling and\nmulti-scaling spectra would then contribute meaningfully to the prediction of\nsolar flares. We find that the fractal dimension of solar magnetic fields and\ntheir multi-fractal spectrum of generalized correlation dimensions do not have\nsignificant predictive ability. The respective multi-fractal structure\nfunctions and their inertial-range scaling exponents, however, probably provide\nsome statistical distinguishing features between flaring and non-flaring active\nregions. More importantly, the temporal evolution of the above scaling\nexponents in flaring active regions probably shows a distinct behavior starting\na few hours prior to a flare and therefore this temporal behavior may be\npractically useful in flare prediction.

For\ninstance the effective equation of state in braneworld models can be both\nquintessence-like (w_0 \\geq -1) as well as phantom-like (w_0 \\leq -1). Models\nwith w_0 \\geq -1 (w_0 \\leq -1) are referred to as Brane 2 (Brane 1) and\ncorrespond to complementary embeddings of the brane in the bulk. (The equation\nof state in Brane 1 can successfully cross the `phantom divide' at w = -1.) In\nthis paper we compare the predictions of braneworld models to two recently\nreleased supernova data sets: the `Gold' data (Riess et al, 2004) and the data\nfrom the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) (Astier et al, 2005). We also\nincorporate the recent discovery of the baryon acoustic peak in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (Eisenstein et al, 2005) into our analysis. Our main results\nare that braneworld models satisfy both sets of SNe data.

We concentrate on the influence of the field\nstrength $E$, length of the chain $N$, and length of the pore $L$ on forced\ntranslocation. As our main result, we find a crossover scaling for the\ntranslocation time $\\tau $ with the chain length from $\\tau \\sim N^{2\\nu}$ for\nrelatively short polymers to $\\tau \\sim N^{1 + \\nu}$ for longer chains, where\n$\\nu $ is the Flory exponent. We demonstrate that this crossover is due to the\nchange in the dependence of the translocation velocity v on the chain length.\nFor relatively short chains $v \\sim N^{- \\nu}$, which crosses over to $v \\sim\nN^{- 1}$ for long polymers. The reason for this is that with increasing $N$\nthere is a high density of segments near the exit of the pore, which slows down\nthe translocation process due to slow relaxation of the chain. For the case of\na long nanopore for which $R_\\parallel $, the radius of gyration $R_{g}$ along\nthe pore, is smaller than the pore length, we find no clear scaling of the\ntranslocation time with the chain length. For large $N$, however, the\nasymptotic scaling $\\tau \\sim N^{1 + \\nu}$ is recovered. In this regime, $\\tau\n$ is almost independent of $L$. We have previously found that for a polymer,\nwhich is initially placed in the middle of the pore, there is a minimum in the\nescape time for $R_\\parallel \\approx L$. We show here that this minimum\npersists for a weak fields $E$ such that $EL$ is less than some critical value,\nbut vanishes for large values of $EL$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2005 16:57:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2006 12:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-26"}

The present advance in enumerative coding is similar\nto that made by arithmetic coding with respect to its unlimited precision\npredecessor, Elias coding. The arithmetic precision, execution time, table\nsizes and coding delay are all reduced by a factor O(n) at a redundancy below\n2*log(e)/2^g bits/symbol (for n input symbols and g-bit QI precision). Due to\nits tighter enumeration, QI output redundancy is below that of arithmetic\ncoding (which can be derived as a lower accuracy approximation of QI). The\nrelative compression gain vanishes in large n and in high entropy limits and\nincreases for shorter outputs and for less predictable data. QI is\nsignificantly faster than the fastest arithmetic coders, from factor 6 in high\nentropy limit to over 100 in low entropy limit (`typically' 10-20 times\nfaster). These speedups are result of using only 3 adds, 1 shift and 2 array\nlookups (all in 32 bit precision) per less probable symbol and no coding\noperations for the most probable symbol .

For a detailed comparison\nof model results with experimentally determined form factors it is necessary to\nemploy a boost from the soliton rest frame to the Breit frame. To enforce\nasymptotic counting rules for form factors, the model must be supplemented by\nsuitably chosen interpolating powers n in the boost prescription. Within the\nminimal pi-rho-omega soliton model, with the same n for both, electric and\nmagnetic form factors, it is possible to obtain a very satisfactory fit to all\navailable proton data for the magnetic form factor and to the recent\npolarization results for the ratio G_E/G_M.

We\nconsider semiparametric models for which solution of infinite dimensional\nestimating equations leads to $\\sqrt{N}$ consistent and asymptotically Gaussian\nestimators of both Euclidean and nonparametric parameters. If the phase two\nsample is selected via Bernoulli (i.i.d.) sampling with known sampling\nprobabilities, standard estimating equation theory shows that the influence\nfunction for the weighted likelihood estimator of the Euclidean parameter is\nthe IPW version of the ordinary influence function. By proving weak convergence\nof the IPW empirical process, and borrowing results on weighted bootstrap\nempirical processes, we derive a parallel asymptotic expansion for finite\npopulation stratified sampling. Whereas the asymptotic variance for Bernoulli\nsampling involves the within strata second moments of the influence function,\nfor finite population stratified sampling it involves only the within strata\nvariances. The latter asymptotic variance also arises when the observed\nsampling fractions are used as estimates of those known a priori. A general\nprocedure is proposed for fitting semiparametric models with estimated weights\nto two phase data. Several of our key results have already been derived for the\nspecial case of Cox regression with stratified case-cohort studies, other\ncomplex survey designs and missing data problems more generally.

A common feature of\nthe resulting algorithms is the use of quantum coset states, which encode the\nhidden subgroup. An open question has been how hard it is to use these states\nto solve graph isomorphism. It was recently shown by Moore, Russell, and\nSchulman that only an exponentially small amount of information is available\nfrom one, or a pair of coset states. A potential source of power to exploit are\nentangled quantum measurements that act jointly on many states at once.
