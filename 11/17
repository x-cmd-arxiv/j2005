While rotation has been the main proposed\nexplanation, other complicating factors such as their constant interaction with\nthe strong gravitational potential of their host galaxy have made it difficult\nfor a consensus to be reached. To address this question we have obtained\nhigh-resolution spectra of WLM-1, the lone globular cluster associated with the\nisolated, low-mass dwarf irregular galaxy WLM. Using archival HST WFPC2 data,\nwe measure the radial ellipticity profile of WLM-1, finding it to be highly\nelliptical, with a mean value of 0.17 in the region 0.5-5\" -- which is\ncomparable to what is found in our Galaxy for the most elliptical globular\nclusters. There is no evidence of isophote twisting, except for the innermost\nregions of the cluster (r < 0.5\"). To investigate whether the observed\nflattening can be ascribed to rotation, we have obtained long-slit\nhigh-resolution VLT/UVES spectra of this cluster along and perpendicular to the\naxis of flattening. Using cross-correlation we find that the velocity profile\nof the cluster is consistent with zero rotation along either axis. Thus neither\ncluster rotation nor galactic tides can be responsible for the flattened\nmorphology of WLM-1. We argue that the required velocity dispersion anisotropy\nbetween the semi-major and semi-minor axes that would be required to account\nfor the observed flattening is relatively small, of order 1 km/s. Even though\nour errors preclude us from conclusively establishing that such a difference\nindeed exists, velocity anisotropy remains at present the most plausible\nexplanation for the shape of this cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2005 22:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The HJW nonlocality\ntells us how, for a given density matrix rho, Alice can generate any\nrho-ensemble on the North Star. This is done using surprisingly few resources -\none shared entangled state (prepared in advance), one generalized quantum\nmeasurement, and no communication. Similarly, our classical nonlocality\npresents how, for a given probability distribution P, Alice can generate any\nP-ensemble on the North Star, using only one correlated state (prepared in\nadvance), one (generalized) classical measurement, and no communication.\n  It is important to clarify that while the classical teleportation and the\nclassical non-locality protocols are probably rather insignificant from a\nclassical information processing point of view, they significantly contribute\nto our understanding of what exactly is quantum in their well established and\nhighly famous quantum analogues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2005 14:23:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2007 16:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

We show how to infer the quantum state of a non-relativistic\nN-dimensional harmonic oscillator system by simple inverse Radon transforms.\nThe procedure is equally applicable to finding the joint quantum state of\nseveral distinguishable particles in different harmonic oscillator potentials.\nA requirement of the procedure is that the angular frequencies of the N\nharmonic potentials are incommensurable. We discuss what kind of information\ncan be found if the requirement of incommensurability is not fulfilled and also\nunder what conditions the state can be reconstructed from finite time\nmeasurements. As a further example of quantum state reconstruction in N\ndimensions we consider the two related cases of an N-dimensional free particle\nwith periodic boundary conditions and a particle in an N-dimensional box, where\nwe find a similar condition of incommensurability and finite recurrence time\nfor the one-dimensional system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2005 13:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We take here for the\nfirst time full account of the effects of Larmor precession and show that it\ngives rise to a qualitatively new type of multimode entangled state of light\nand atoms. The protocol is shown to be robust against the dominating sources of\nnoise and can be implemented with an atomic ensemble at room temperature\ninteracting with free space light. We also provide a scheme to perform the\nreadout of the Larmor precessing spin state enabling the verification of\nsuccessful teleportation as well as the creation of spin squeezing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2005 13:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
