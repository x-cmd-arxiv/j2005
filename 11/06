While some particles gain and others lose, friction arises when\nthere is an excess of gainers over losers. This imbalance results from the\ngenerally decreasing numbers of particles with increasing angular momentum, and\nfriction can therefore be avoided if there is no gradient in the density of\nparticles across the major resonances. Here we show that anomalously weak\nfriction can occur for this reason if the pattern speed of the bar fluctuates\nupwards. After such an event, the density of resonant halo particles has a\nlocal inflexion created by the earlier exchanges, and bar slowdown can be\ndelayed for a long period; we describe this as a metastable state. We show that\nthis behavior in purely collisionless N-body simulations is far more likely to\noccur in methods with adaptive resolution. We also show that the phenomenon\ncould arise in nature, since bar-driven gas inflow could easily raise the bar\npattern speed enough to reach the metastable state. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat mild external, or internal, perturbations quickly restore the usual\nfrictional drag, and it is unlikely therefore that a strong bar in a galaxy\nhaving a dense halo could rotate for a long period without friction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2005 17:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

High energy corrections to the standard\nfour-dimensional Friedmann equation induce a corresponding modification to the\nform of the single-field inflationary consistency equation based on Einstein\ngravity. The degree of departure from the standard expression is determined by\nthe ratio, r, of the primordial tensor and scalar perturbation amplitudes and\nthe coefficient, c, of the conformal anomaly in the dual gauge theory. It is\nfound that a necessary condition for detecting such a correction with the next\ngeneration of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiments is\nthat r >= 0.06.

This is close to the present upper bounds inferred from combined\nobservations of the CMB anisotropy power spectrum and high redshift surveys.

In fact, we use this scheme for further generalisation devoted to\na constrained particle, to a discrete system of several free and constrained\nparticles.\n  For constrained systems we have intrinsic and extrinsic viewpoints, with\nrespect to the environmental space. In the second case, we obtain an explicit\nformula for the reaction force via the second fundamental form of the\nconstrained configuration space. For multi--particle systems we describe\ngeometrically the splitting related to the center of mass and relative\nvelocities; in this way we emphasise the geometric source of classical\nformulas.\n  Then, the above scheme is applied in detail to discrete rigid systems. We\nstart by analysing the geometry of the rigid configuration space. In this way\nwe recover the classical formula for the velocity of the rigid system via the\nparallelisation of Lie groups. Moreover, we study in detail the splitting of\nthe tangent and cotangent environmental space into the three components of\ncenter of mass, of relative velocities and of the orthogonal subspace. This\nsplitting yields the classical components of linear and angular momentum (which\nhere arise from a purely geometric construction) and, moreover, a third non\nstandard component. The third projection yields an explicit formula for the\nreaction force in the nodes of the rigid constraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2005 17:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Then we impose a rigid constraint on the\nmulti-configuration space. The resulting space is then dealt with as a\nconfiguration space of a single abstract `particle'. The same idea is applied\nto all geometric and dynamical structures.\n  We show that the above configuration space fits into the general framework of\n``covariant quantum mechanics''. Hence, the methods of this theory can be\napplied to the rigid body.\n  Accordingly, we find exactly two inequivalent choices of quantum structures\nfor the rigid body. Then, we evaluate the quantum energy and momentum operators\nand the `rotational part' of their spectra. We provide a new mathematical\ninterpretation of two-valued wavefunctions on SO(3) in terms of single-valued\nsections of a new non-trivial quantum bundle.
