We find that variations in halo concentration or formation epoch\n(which might determine the time available for low entropy gas to cool out) are\ninsufficient to explain the amount of scatter in the mass-luminosity relation.\nInstead, a range of entropy floors at a fixed halo mass, spanning approximately\n50 keV sq.cm to 700 keV sq.cm, is required to match the data.

The large tunneling\nmagnetoresistance (TMR) observed in MTJs garnered much attention due to\npossible application in random access memories and magnetic field sensors. This\nled to a number of fundamental questions regarding the phenomenon of SDT. One\nsuch question is the role of interfaces in MTJs and their effect on the spin\npolarization of the tunneling current and TMR. In this paper we consider\ndifferent models which suggest that the spin polarization is primarily\ndetermined by the electronic and atomic structure of the ferromagnet/insulator\ninterfaces rather than by their bulk properties. First, we consider a simple\ntight-binding model which demonstrates that the existence of interface states\nand their contribution to the tunneling current depend on the degree of\nhybridization between the orbitals on metal and insulator atoms. The decisive\nrole of the interfaces is further supported by studies of spin-dependent\ntunneling within realistic first-principles models of Co/vacuum/Al,\nCo/Al2O3/Co, Fe/MgO/Fe, and Co/SrTiO3/Co MTJs. We find that variations in the\natomic potentials and bonding strength near the interfaces have a profound\neffect resulting in the formation of interface resonant states, which\ndramatically affect the spin polarization and TMR. The strong sensitivity of\nthe tunneling spin polarization and TMR to the interface atomic and electronic\nstructure dramatically expands the possibilities for engineering optimal MTJ\nproperties for device applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2005 17:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-09"}

The method is used to analyze band\nstructure and dispersion properties of several types of resonant photonic\ncrystals, which would not submit to analytical treatment by other approaches.\nThese systems include multiple quantum well structures with an arbitrary\nperiodic modulation of the dielectric function and structures with a complex\nelementary cell. Special attention was paid to determining conditions for\nsuperradiance (Bragg resonance) in these structures, and to the properties of\nthe polariton stop band in the case when this condition is fulfilled (Bragg\nstructures). The dependence of the band structure on the angle of propagation,\nthe polarization of the wave, and the effects due to exciton homogeneous and\ninhomogeneous broadenings are considered, as well as dispersion properties of\nexcitations in near-Bragg structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2005 21:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The aim of the mission is to detect gravitational waves in a low\nfrequency band. For properly processing the science data, the propagation\ndelays between spacecraft must be accurately known. We thus analyse the\npropagation of light between spacecraft in order to systematically derive the\nrelativistic effects due to the static curvature of the Schwarzschild spacetime\nin which the spacecraft are orbiting with time-varying light-distances. In\nparticular, our analysis allows to evaluate rigorously the Sagnac effect, and\nthe gravitational (Einstein) redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2005 11:16:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 May 2006 09:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Rather than\nsolving the problem from scratch each time new observations become available,\none uses the model to ``forecast'' the current state, using a prior state\nestimate (which incorporates information from past data) as the initial\ncondition, then uses current data to correct the prior forecast to a current\nstate estimate. This Bayesian approach is most effective when the uncertainty\nin both the observations and in the state estimate, as it evolves over time,\nare accurately quantified.

The method is a\ntype of ``ensemble Kalman filter'', in which the state estimate and its\napproximate uncertainty are represented at any given time by an ensemble of\nsystem states. We discuss both the mathematical basis of this approach and its\nimplementation; our primary emphasis is on ease of use and computational speed\nrather than improving accuracy over previously published approaches to ensemble\nKalman filtering. We include some numerical results demonstrating the\nefficiency and accuracy of our implementation for assimilating real atmospheric\ndata with the global forecast model used by the U.S. National Weather Service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2005 18:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2006 11:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
