Our spectroscopic dataset\nconsists of over 1600 galaxy cluster members, of which two thirds are outside\nr_200. We assign cluster membership using a detailed mass model and expand on\nour previous work on the cluster colour-magnitude relation where membership was\ninferred statistically. We confirm that the modal colours of galaxies on the\ncolour magnitude relation become progressively bluer with increasing radius and\ndecreasing local galaxy density. Interpreted as an age effect, we hypothesize\nthat these trends in galaxy colour should be reflected in mean Hdelta\nequivalent width. We confirm that passive galaxies in the cluster increase in\nHdelta line strength as dHdelta / d r_p = 0.35 +/- 0.06. A variation of star\nformation rate, as measured by [OII], with increasing local density of the\nenvironment is discernible and is shown to be in broad agreement with previous\nstudies from 2dFGRS and SDSS. We find that clusters at z~0.1 are less active\nthan their higher redshift analogues. We also investigate unusual populations\nof blue and very red nonstarforming galaxies and we suggest that the former are\nlikely to be the progenitors of galaxies which will lie on the colour-magnitude\nrelation, while the colours of the latter possibly reflect dust reddening. The\ncluster galaxies at large radii consist of both backsplash ones and those that\nare infalling to the cluster for the first time. We make a comparison to the\nfield population at z~0.1 and examine broad differences between the two\npopulations. Individually, the clusters show significant variation in their\ngalaxy populations which reflects their recent infall histories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2005 02:09:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

LP energy spectra can be obtained for relativistic\nelectrons by means of a statistical acceleration mechanism whose probability of\nacceleration depends on energy. In this paper we compute the spectra radiated\nby an electron population via synchrotron (S) and Synchro-Self Compton(SSC)\nprocesses to derive the relations between the LP parameters. These spectra were\nobtained by means of an accurate numerical code. We found that the ratio\nbetween the curvature parameters of the S spectrum to that of the electrons is\nequal to about 0.2 instead of 0.25, the value foreseen in the delta\napproximation. Inverse Compton spectra are also intrinsically curved and can be\napproximated by a log-parabola only in limited ranges. The curvature parameter,\nestimated around the SED peak, may vary from a lower value than that of the S\nspectrum up to that of emitting electrons depending on whether the scattering\nis in the Thomson or in the Klein-Nishina regime. We applied this analysis to\ncomputing the SSC emission from the BL Lac object Mkn 501 during the large\nflare of April 1997. We fit simultaneous BeppoSAX and CAT data and reproduced\nintensities and spectral curvatures of both components with good accuracy. The\nlarge curvature observed in the TeV range was found to be mainly intrinsic, and\ntherefore did not require a large pair production absorption against the\nextragalactic background.

This collapse of thermodynamic observables creates a regime of\nextended universality in the phase diagram and an emergent symmetry, not\npresent in the Hamiltonian. For p \\ge 8, the collapse starts in the\nquasi-liquid phase and makes the transition at T2 identical to the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition of the con-tinuous rotor. For\np \\le 6, the transition at T2 is below Teu and no longer BKT. The results\ngenerate a comprehensive map of the critical properties at T1 and T2, and a\nrange of experimental predictions, such as motion of magnetic domain walls,\nfab-rication of identical devices from different building blocks, and limits on\nmacro-scopic distinguishability of different microscopic interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2005 20:38:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2006 00:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In this limit, this capacity\nwithout any receiver CSI is the same as the capacity with full receiver CSI--a\nphenomenon also true for dirty paper coding. For Rayleigh fading, this capacity\n(per unit time) is proportional to the logarithm of the bandwidth. Our coding\nscheme is motivated from the Gel'fand-Pinsker [2,3] coding and dirty paper\ncoding [4].
