A 3D calculation is also done to confirm the results of the 2D ones. We\nconsider an initially spherical cloud whose density distribution is flat near\nthe cloud center and has a power-law profile in the cloud envelope. When an\nincident shock is transmitted into a smooth cloud, velocity gradients in the\ncloud envelope steepen the smooth density profile at the upstream side,\nresulting in a sharp density jump having an arc-like shape. Such a ``slip\nsurface'' forms immediately when a shock strikes a cloud with a sharp boundary.\nFor smoother boundaries, the formation of slip surface and therefore the onset\nof hydrodynamic instabilities are delayed. Since the slip surface is subject to\nthe Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, the shocked cloud is\neventually destroyed in $\\sim 3-10$ cloud crushing times. After complete cloud\ndestruction, small blobs formed by fragmentation due to hydrodynamic\ninstabilities have significant velocity dispersions of the order of 0.1 $v_b$,\nwhere $v_b$ is the shock velocity in the ambient medium. This suggests that\nturbulent motions generated by shock-cloud interaction are directly associated\nwith cloud destruction. The interaction of a shock with a cold HI cloud should\nlead to the production of a spray of small HI shreds, which could be related to\nthe small cold clouds recently observed by Stanimirovic & Heiles (2005).

Their original \"hybrid\" scheme was based on\ncombining exact relativistic expressions for the evolution of the orbital\nelements (the semi-latus rectum p and eccentricity e) with approximate,\nweak-field, formula for the energy and angular momentum fluxes, amended by the\nassumption of constant inclination angle, iota, during the inspiral. Despite\nthe fact that the resulting inspirals were overall well-behaved, certain\npathologies remained for orbits in the strong field regime and for orbits which\nare nearly circular and/or nearly polar. In this paper we eliminate these\nproblems by incorporating an array of improvements in the approximate fluxes.\nFirstly, we add certain corrections which ensure the correct behaviour of the\nfluxes in the limit of vanishing eccentricity and/or 90 degrees inclination.\nSecondly, we use higher order post-Newtonian formulae, adapted for generic\norbits. Thirdly, we drop the assumption of constant inclination. Instead, we\nfirst evolve the Carter constant by means of an approximate post-Newtonian\nexpression and subsequently extract the evolution of iota. Finally, we improve\nthe evolution of circular orbits by using fits to the angular momentum and\ninclination evolution determined by Teukolsky based calculations. As an\napplication of the improved scheme we provide a sample of generic Kerr\ninspirals and for the specific case of nearly circular orbits we locate the\ncritical radius where orbits begin to decircularise under radiation reaction.\nThese easy-to-generate inspirals should become a useful tool for exploring LISA\ndata analysis issues and may ultimately play a role in source detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2005 16:27:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2006 09:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

For DNA this leads to a rich variety of mesophases for\ncolumnar assemblies, each categorized by a specific azimuthal ordering. In a\npreceding paper [A. Wynveen, D. J. Lee, and A. A. Kornyshev, Eur. Phys. J. E,\n16, 303 (2005)] a statistical mechanical theory was developed for the\nassemblies of torsionally rigid molecues in order to determine how thermal\nfluctuations influence the structure of these mesophases. Here we extend this\ntheory by including torsional fluctuations of the molecules, where a DNA\nmolecule may twist about its long axis at the cost of torsional elastic energy.\nComparing this with the previous study, we find that inclusion of torsional\nfluctuations further increases the density at which the transition between the\nhexagonal structure and the predicted rhombic phase occurs and reduces the\nlevel of distortion in the rhombic phase. As X-ray diffraction may probe the\n2-D lattice structure of such assemblies and provide information concerning the\nunderlying interaction between molecules, we have also calculated correlation\nfunctions for the azimuthal ordering which are manifest in an x-ray scattering\nintensity profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2005 12:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
