However, in order to interpret the\nasteroseismological data, the effective temperature, surface gravity, and\nchemical composition of the stars must be known with sufficient accuracy. To\ncarry out this task, we have developed a spectroscopic method called APASS\n(Atmospheric Parameters and Abundances from Synthetic Spectra) which allows\nprecise analysis of stars with a moderate to high rotational velocity, which is\nthe case for most primary COROT targets. Our method is based on synthetic\nspectra and works differentially with respect to the Sun.

Both the far-ultraviolet (FUV) flux as well as the\nspectral shape vary substantially over the orbital period, with maximum flux\noccurring at the same phase as during the high state. The variations are due to\nthe presence of a hot spot on the white dwarf, which we model quantitatively.\nThe white dwarf parameters can be determined from a spectral fit to the faint\nphase data, when the hot spot is self-eclipsed. Adopting the distance of\n79+8-6pc determined by Thorstensen, we find an effective temperature of\n19800+-700K and a mass of Mwd=0.78+0.12-0.17Msun. The hot spot has a lower\ntemperature than during the high state, ~34000-40000K, but covers a similar\narea, ~10% of the white dwarf surface. Low state FUSE and STIS spectra taken\nduring four different epochs in 2002/3 show no variation of the FUV flux level\nor spectral shape, implying that the white dwarf temperature and the hot spot\ntemperature, size, and location do not depend on the amount of time the system\nhas spent in the low state. Possible explanations are ongoing accretion at a\nlow level, or deep heating, both alternatives have some weaknesses that we\ndiscuss.

One basic\nbuilding block is the spin-valve, which is formed if two ferromagnetic\nelectrodes are separated by a thin tunneling barrier. In such devices, R\ndepends on the orientation of the magnetisation of the electrodes. It is\nusually larger in the antiparallel than in the parallel configuration. The\nrelative difference of R, the so-called magneto-resistance (MR), is then\npositive. Common devices, such as the giant magneto-resistance sensor used in\nreading heads of hard disks, are based on this phenomenon. The MR may become\nanomalous (negative), if the transmission probability of electrons through the\ndevice is spin or energy dependent. This offers a route to the realisation of\ngate-tunable MR devices, because transmission probabilities can readily be\ntuned in many devices with an electrical gate signal. Such devices have,\nhowever, been elusive so far. We report here on a pronounced gate-field\ncontrolled MR in devices made from carbon nanotubes with ferromagnetic\ncontacts. Both the amplitude and the sign of the MR are tunable with the gate\nvoltage in a predictable manner. We emphasise that this spin-field effect is\nnot restricted to carbon nanotubes but constitutes a generic effect which can\nin principle be exploited in all resonant tunneling devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2005 13:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}
