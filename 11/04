This effect is partly responsible for the apparent inhomogeneous N\nabundance empirically derived.

This accretion-ejection paradigm provides a simple\nexplanation to the canonical spectral states by varying the transition radius\nr_J and disc accretion rate independently. Large values of r_J correspond to\nthe Quiescent state for low $\\dot m$ and the Hard state for larger $\\dot m$.\nThese states are characterized by the presence of a steady electron-proton MHD\njet emitted by the disc below r_J. The hard X-ray component is expected to form\nat the jet basis. When r_j becomes smaller than the marginally stable orbit\nr_i, the whole disc resembles a standard accretion disc, characteristic of the\nSoft state. Intermediate states correspond to situations where r_J ~ r_i. At\nlarge $\\dot m$, an unsteady pair cascade process is triggered within the jet\naxis, giving birth to ejection of relativistic pair blobs. This would\ncorrespond to the luminous intermediate state, with its associated superluminal\nmotions. The variation of r_J independently of $\\dot m$ is a necessary\ningredient in this picture, arising from the presence of a large scale vertical\nmagnetic field threading the disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2005 09:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We are interested in the gauge dynamics just on the\ncritical line, in particular, whether a Coulomb-like deconfinement phase is\nrealized there. This problem is quite important to clarify low-energy\nexcitations in certain class of quantum spin models. If the gauge dynamics is\nin the deconfinement phase there, spinons, which transform in the fundamental\nrepresentation of the SU($N_{\\rm f}$) symmetry, appear as low-energy\nexcitations. By Monte-Carlo simulations, we found that the \"phase structure\" on\nthe {\\em criticality} strongly depends on the value of $N_{\\rm f}$. For small\n$N_{\\rm f}$, the confinement phase is realized, whereas the deconfinement phase\nappears for sufficient large $N_{\\rm f}\\ge 14$. This result strongly suggests\nthat compact QED$_3$ is in a deconfinement phase for sufficiently large number\nof flavors of massless fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2005 11:32:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2005 08:13:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2005 09:05:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2006 06:30:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

In this paper we present the\nformalism for computing corrections to lensing observables for static,\nspherically symmetric gravity theories in which the corrections to the\nweak-deflection limit can be expanded as a Taylor series in one parameter,\nnamely the gravitational radius of the lens object. We take care to derive\ncoordinate-independent expressions and compute quantities that are directly\nobservable. We compute first- and second-order corrections to the image\npositions, magnifications, and time delays. Interestingly, we find that the\nfirst-order corrections to the total magnification and centroid position vanish\nin all gravity theories that agree with general relativity in the\nweak-deflection limit, but they can remain nonzero in modified theories that\ndisagree with GR in the weak-deflection limit. For the Reissner-Nordstrom\nmetric and a related metric from heterotic string theory, our formalism reveals\nan intriguing connection between lensing observables and the condition for\nhaving a naked singularity, which could provide an observational method for\ntesting the existence of such objects. We apply our formalism to the Galactic\nblack hole and predict that the corrections to the image positions are at the\nlevel of 10 micro-arcseconds, while the correction to the time delay is a few\nhundredths of a second. These corrections would be measurable today if a pulsar\nwere found to be lensed by the Galactic black hole; and they should be readily\ndetectable with planned missions like MAXIM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2005 14:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This work was mainly motivated\nby the hypothesis which claims that Weyl geometries mimic quantum behaviour\nclassically. We start by obtaining a classical 4-dimensional Poincare invariant\nthick brane solution which does not respect Z_2-symmetry along the\n(non-)compact extra dimension. The scalar energy density of our field\nconfiguration represents several series of thick branes with positive and\nnegative energy densities centered at y_0. The only qualitative difference we\nhave encountered when comparing both frames is that the scalar curvature of the\nRiemannian manifold turns out to be singular for the found solution, whereas\nits Weylian counterpart presents a regular behaviour. By studying the\ntransverse traceless modes of the fluctuations of the classical backgrounds, we\nrecast their equations into a Schroedinger's equation form with a volcano\npotential of finite bottom (in both frames). By solving the Schroedinger\nequation for the massless zero mode m^2=0 we obtain a single bound state which\nrepresents a stable 4-dimensional graviton in both frames. We also get a\ncontinuum gapless spectrum of KK states with positive m^2>0 that are suppressed\nat y_0, turning into continuum plane wave modes as \"y\" approaches spatial\ninfinity. We show that for the considered solution to our setup, the potential\nis always bounded and cannot adopt the form of a well with infinite walls;\nthus, we do not get a discrete spectrum of KK states, and we conclude that the\nclaim that Weylian structures mimic, classically, quantum behaviour does not\nconstitute a generic feature of these geometric manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2005 03:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

It is shown that the\n{\\it stoichiometric sensitivity} of an intermediary metabolite concentration\nwith respect to changes in steady-state flux is governed by the effective\nequilibrium constant of the intermediate formation, and the equilibrium can be\nregulated by a futile cycle. The direction of the shift in the effective\nequilibrium constant depends on the direction of operation of the futile cycle.\nHigh stoichiometric sensitivity corresponds to ultrasensitivity of an\nintermediate concentration to net flow through a pathway; low stoichiometric\nsensitivity corresponds to super-robustness of concentration with respect to\nchanges in flux. Both cases potentially play important roles in metabolic\nregulation. Futile cycles actively shift the effective equilibrium by expending\nenergy; the magnitude of changes in effective equilibria and sensitivities is a\nfunction of the amount of energy used by a futile cycle. This proposed\nmechanism for control by futile cycles works remarkably similarly to kinetic\nproofreading in biosynthesis. The sensitivity of the system is also intimately\nrelated to the rate of concentration fluctuations of intermediate metabolites.\nThe possibly different roles of the two major mechanisms for cellular\nbiochemical regulation, namely reversible chemical modifications via futile\ncycles and shifting equilibrium by macromolecular binding, are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2005 07:18:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2006 19:40:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Our formulation is based on the variational principle and is analogous\nto that for the brachistochrone in classical mechanics. We reduce the problem\nto a formal equation for the Hamiltonian which depends on certain constraint\nfunctions specifying the range of available Hamiltonians. For some simple\nexamples of the constraints, we explicitly find the optimal solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2005 09:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
