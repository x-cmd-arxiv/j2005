We combine high\nresolution N-body simulations of the evolution of the dark matter with a\nsemi-analytic model for the formation and evolution of galaxies which includes\ndetailed prescriptions for the long-term evolution of galactic winds. This\nmodel is the first to describe the evolution of outflows as a two-phase process\n(an adiabatic bubble followed by a momentum--driven shell) and to include\nmetal--dependent cooling of the outflowing material. We find that the main\nstatistical properties of the Lyalpha forest, namely the flux power spectrum\nP(k) and the flux probability distribution function (PDF), are not\nsignificantly affected by winds and so do not significantly constrain wind\nmodels. Winds around galaxies do, however, produce detectable signatures in the\nforest, in particular, increased flux transmissivity inside hot bubbles, and\nnarrow, saturated absorption lines caused by dense cooled shells. We find that\nthe Lyalpha flux transmissivity is highly enhanced near strongly wind-blowing\ngalaxies, almost half of all high-redshift galaxies in our sample, in agreement\nwith the results of Adelberger et al. (2005). Finally, we propose a new method\nto identify absorption lines potentially due to wind shells in the Lyalpha\nforest: we calculate the abundance of saturated regions in spectra as a\nfunction of region width and we find that the number with widths smaller than\nabout 1 Angstrom at z=3 and 0.6 Angstrom at z=2 may be more than doubled.

Comparing the\ngas-phase abundance ratios of these high redshift galaxies, we found that they\nshow low RMS dispersions, reaching only up 2-3 times the statistical errors for\nthe majority of elements.

The\ngas-phase abundance patterns of interstellar medium clouds within the DLA\ngalaxies detected along the velocity profiles show, on the other hand, a high\ndispersion in several abundance ratios, indicating that chemical variations\nseem to be more confined to individual clouds within the DLA galaxies than to\nintegrated profiles. The analysis of the cloud-to-cloud chemical variations\nwithin seven individual DLAs reveals that five of them show statistically\nsignificant variations, higher than 0.2 dex at more than 3 sigma. The sources\nof these variations are both the differential dust depletion and/or ionization\neffects; however, no evidence for variations due to different star formation\nhistories could be highlighted.

Both clusters are extremely massive, being more than three times heavier\nthan the most massive globular clusters in the Galaxy. For both clusters we\nmeasure light-to-mass ratios, which when compared to simple stellar population\n(SSP) models of the appropriate age, are consistent with a Kroupa-type stellar\nmass function. Using measurements from the literature we find a strong age\ndependence on how well SSP models (with underlying Kroupa or Salpeter-type\nstellar mass functions) fit the light-to-mass ratio of clusters. Based on this\nresult we suggest that the large scatter in the light-to-mass ratio of the\nyoungest clusters is not due to variations in the underlying stellar mass\nfunction, but instead to the rapidly changing internal dynamics of young\nclusters. Finally, based on the positions of old globular clusters, young\nmassive clusters (YMCs), ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) and dwarf-globular\ntransition objects (DGTOs) in kappa-space we conclude that 1) UCDs and DGTOs\nare consistent with the high mass end of star clusters and 2) YMCs occupy a\nmuch larger parameter space than old globular clusters, consistent with the\nidea of preferential disruption of star clusters.

As\nthe black hole grows, an outflow drives a shell into the surrounding gas. This\nstalls after a dynamical time at a size determined by the hole's current mass\nand thereafter grows on the Salpeter timescale. The gas trapped inside this\nbubble cools and forms stars and is recycled as accretion and outflow. The\nconsequent high metallicity agrees with that commonly observed in AGN\naccretion. Once the hole reaches a critical mass this region attains a size\nsuch that the gas can no longer cool efficiently. The resulting energy-driven\nflow expels the remaining gas as a superwind, fixing both the M_BH - sigma\nrelation and the total stellar bulge mass at values in good agreement with\nobservation. Black hole growth thus produces starbursts and ultimately a\nsuperwind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2005 16:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Departures of their orbits from freely precessing ellipses\nresult from mutual interactions via their 121:118 mean motion resonance.\nMotions are chaotic because the resonance is split into four overlapping\ncomponents. Orbital longitudes were observed to drift away from Voyager\npredictions, and a sudden jump in mean motions took place close to the time at\nwhich the orbits' apses were antialigned in 2000. Numerical integrations\nreproduce both the longitude drifts and the jumps. The latter have been\nattributed to the greater strength of interactions near apse antialignment\n(every 6.2 years), and it has been assumed that this drift-jump behavior will\ncontinue indefinitely. We re-examine the dynamics by analogy with that of a\nnearly adiabatic, parametric pendulum. In terms of this analogy, the current\nvalue of the action of the satellite system is close to its maximum in the\nchaotic zone. Consequently, at present, the two separatrix crossings per\nprecessional cycle occur close to apse antialignment. In this state libration\nonly occurs when the potential's amplitude is nearly maximal, and the 'jumps'\nin mean motion arise during the short intervals of libration that separate long\nstretches of circulation. Because chaotic systems explore the entire region of\nphase space available to them, we expect that at other times the system would\nbe found in states of medium or low action. In a low action state it would\nspend most of the time in libration, and separatrix crossings would occur near\napse alignment.

Both methods can constraint the equation of state of dark energy\n$w$ to about 5-10% when applied to forthcoming and future surveys, and probe\n$w$ in complementary redshift ranges, which could shed some light on its time\nevolution. These determinations of $w$ do not rely on the knowledge of cluster\nmasses, although they make minimal assumptions on cluster physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2005 15:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The characteristic length scale associated with this decay is the\nspin diffusion length. The DD model also predicts that this length is different\nfor ``upstream'' electrons traveling in a decelerating electric field than for\n``downstream'' electrons traveling in an accelerating field. However this\npicture ignores energy quantization in confined systems (e.g. quantum wires)\nand therefore fails to capture the non-trivial influence of subband structure\non spin relaxation.

Because the basis satisfies fermionic superselection rules, the\nresulting phase space involves only c-numbers, without requiring anti-commuting\nGrassmann variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2005 06:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Most people in the field consider the inconsistency\nbetween local realistic theories and quantum mechanics to be a result of\nnon-local nature of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we derive Bell's\ninequality for particles with instantaneous interactions, and show that the\naforementioned contradiction still exists between quantum mechanics and\nnon-local hidden variable models. Then, we use this non-locality to obtain the\nGHZ theorem. In what follows, we show that Bacon and Toner's protocol, for the\nsimulation of Bell correlation, by using local hidden variables augmented by\nclassical communication, have some inconsistency with quantum mechanics. Our\napproach can answer to Brassard questions from another viewpoint, we show that\nif we accept that our nature obeys quantum mechanical laws, then all of quantum\nmechanic results cannot be simulated by realistic theories augmented by\nclassical communication or a single instance use of non-local box.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2005 09:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Sep 2006 05:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
