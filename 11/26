Its essential physics is the separation of the gas phase from the\nliquid. Of course, boiling water is inhomogeneous and as such cannot be treated\nby conventional thermo-statistics.

It turns out that the Boltzmann-Planck statistics is much richer\nand gives fundamental insight into statistical mechanics and especially into\nentropy. This can be done to a far extend rigorously and analytically. As no\nextensivity, no thermodynamic limit, no concavity, no homogeneity is needed, it\nalso applies to astro-physical systems. The deep and essential difference\nbetween ``extensive'' and ``intensive'' control parameters, i.e. microcanonical\nand canonical statistics, is exemplified by rotating, self-gravitating systems.\nIn the present paper the necessary appearance of a convex entropy S(E) and\nnegative heat capacity at phase separation in small as well macroscopic systems\nindependently of the range of the force is pointed out.

Both\nspectral and variability properties of the source indicate that Cygnus X-1 was\nin an Intermediate State. The INTEGRAL spectrum shows a high-energy cut-off or\nbreak around 100 keV. The shape of this cut-off differs from pure thermal\nComptonisation, suggesting the presence of a non-thermal component at higher\nenergies.The average broad band spectrum is well represented by hybrid\nthermal/non-thermal Comptonisation models. During the 4 day long observation\nthe source showed an important spectral and flux variability. A principal\ncomponent analysis demonstrates that most of this variability occurs through 2\nindependent modes. The first mode consists in changes in the overall luminosity\non time scale of hours with almost constant spectra that are strikingly\nuncorrelated with the variable radio flux. We interpret this variability mode\nas variations of the dissipation rate in the corona. The second variability\nmode consists in a pivoting of the spectrum around 10 keV. It acts on a longer\ntime-scale: initially soft, the spectrum hardens in the first part of the\nobservation and then softens again. This pivoting pattern is strongly\ncorrelated with the radio (15 GHz) emission: radio fluxes are stronger when the\nINTEGRAL spectrum is harder. We propose that the pivoting mode represents a\n'mini' state transition from a nearly High Soft State to a nearly Low Hard\nState, and back. This mini-transition would be caused by changes in the soft\ncooling photons flux in the hot Comptonising plasma associated with an increase\nof the temperature of the accretion disc. The jet power then appears to be\nanti-correlated with the disc luminosity and unrelated to the coronal power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2005 17:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
