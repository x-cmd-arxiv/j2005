It was reported that during the prompt high energy\nemission phase, a very bright optical flare was detected, and it was temporal\ncoincident with an X-ray flare. Here we use two models to explain the optical\nflare, One is the \"late internal shock model\", in which the optical flare is\nproduced by the synchrotron radiation of the electrons accelerated by the late\ninternal shock, and the X-ray flare is produced by the synchrotron-self-Compton\nmechanism. The other is the external forward-reverse shock model, in which the\noptical flare is from the reverse shock emission and the X-ray flare is\nattributed to the central engine activity. We show that with proper parameters,\na bright optical flare can appear in both models. We think the \"late internal\nshock model\" is more favored since in this model the optical flash and the\nX-ray flare have the same origin, which provides a natural explanation of the\ntemporal coincidence of them. In the forward-reverse shock scenario, fits to\nthe optical flare and the late afterglow suggests that the physical parameters\nof the reverse shock are much different from that of forward shock, as found in\nmodeling the optical flash of GRB 990123 previously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2005 09:25:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2005 12:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In particular, a coherent lattice oscillation and coherent\nmotion of a macroscopic domain boundary need appropriate interactions among\nelectrons and lattice displacements.

In order to circumvent the\nundecidability of model checking for nondeterministic\n  LCSs, probabilistic models have been introduced, where it can be decided\nwhether a linear-time property holds almost surely. However, such fully\nprobabilistic systems are not a faithful model of nondeterministic protocols.\n  We study a hybrid model for LCSs where losses of messages are seen as faults\noccurring with some given probability, and where the internal behavior of the\nsystem remains nondeterministic. Thus the semantics is in terms of\ninfinite-state Markov decision processes. The purpose of this article is to\ndiscuss the decidability of linear-time properties formalized by formulas of\nlinear temporal logic (LTL). Our focus is on the qualitative setting where one\nasks, e.g., whether a LTL-formula holds almost surely or with zero probability\n(in case the formula describes the bad behaviors). Surprisingly, it turns out\nthat -- in contrast to finite-state Markov decision processes -- the\nsatisfaction relation for LTL formulas depends on the chosen type of schedulers\nthat resolve the nondeterminism. While all variants of the qualitative LTL\nmodel checking problem for the full class of history-dependent schedulers are\nundecidable, the same questions for finite-memory scheduler can be solved\nalgorithmically. However, the restriction to reachability properties and\nspecial kinds of recurrent reachability properties yields decidable\nverification problems for the full class of schedulers, which -- for this\nrestricted class of properties -- are as powerful as finite-memory schedulers,\nor even a subclass of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2005 17:03:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2005 16:58:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2006 14:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-19"}
