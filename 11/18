Such informations, once applied to apparently\nextended mid-infrared sources, which are indeed ``blends'' of two or more\ndifferent sources, allow us to disentangle the single counterparts and to split\nthe measured flux density into different components. We present the application\nof this method to the 24 micron Spitzer archival data in the GOODS-EN1 test\nfield, where apparently extended, ``blended'' sources constitute about 20% of a\nreliable sample of 983 sources detected above the 5-sigma threshold down to 23\nmicroJy. As higher frequency data-set we have considered the public IRAC images\nand catalogues on the same field. We show that the 24 micron sample is almost\nunbiased down to ~40 microJy and the careful application of the deblending\nprocedure does not require any statistical completeness correction (at least at\nthe flux level considered). This is probed by direct comparison of our results\nwith those of Chary et al. (2004), who analysed the same data-set through\nextensive Monte Carlo simulations. The deblending procedure reduces of about\n30% the confusion limit of the MIPS 24 micron survey, allowing one to obtain\nreliable source counts down to ~40 microJy. The extrapolation of the source\ncounts down to fainter fluxes suggests that our 24 micron sample is able to\nresolve ~62% of the cosmic background down to a flux level of 38 microJy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2005 15:38:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

At higher densities its\nexcitation spectrum develops a minimum, similar to the roton minimum in helium,\nat momenta where the excitations are in resonance with the Fermi sea.

This selectivity is explained thermodynamically in terms of favorable\npartitioning of K+ relative to Na+ in a narrow selectivity filter in the\nchannel. One mechanism for selectivity based on the atomic structure of the\nKcsA channel invokes the size difference between K+ and Na+, and the molecular\ncomplementarity of the selectivity filter with the larger K+ ion. An\nalternative view holds that size-based selectivity is precluded because atomic\nstructural fluctuations are greater than the size difference between these two\nions. We examine these hypotheses by calculating the distribution of binding\nenergies for Na+ and K+ in a simplified model of the selectivity filter of the\nKcsA channel. We find that Na+ binds strongly to the selectivity filter with a\nmean binding energy substantially lower than that for K+. The difference is\ncomparable to the difference in hydration free energies of Na+ and K+ in bulk\naqueous solution. Thus, the average filter binding energies do not discriminate\nNa+ from K+ when measured from the baseline of the difference in bulk hydration\nfree energies. Instead, Na+/K+ discrimination can be attributed to scarcity of\ngood binding configurations for Na+ compared to K+. That relative scarcity is\nquantified as enhanced binding energy fluctuations, and is consistent with\npredicted relative constriction of the filter by Na+.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2005 17:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In an duct for example this advance must\nbe larger than the delays in the secondary path from the control source to the\nerror sensor. In this paper it is shown that, in some cases, the advance\nrequired for perfect noise cancellation is theoretically infinite because the\ninverse of the secondary path, which is required for control, can include an\ninfinite non-causal response. This is shown to be the result of two mechanisms:\nin the single-channel case (one control source and one error sensor), this can\narise because of strong echoes in the control path. In the multi-channel case\nthis can arise even in free field simply because of an unfortunate placing of\nsensors and actuators. In the present paper optimal feedforward control is\nderived through analytical and numerical computations, in the time and\nfrequency domains. It is shown that, in practice, the advance required for\nsignificant noise attenuation can be much larger than the secondary path\ndelays.
