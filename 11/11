Instruments such as Compton-GRO/BATSE and the GRB monitor on BeppoSAX\nhave detected more than 2700 GRBs and, although observational confirmation is\nstill required, it is now generally accepted that many of these bursts are\nassociated with the collapse of rapidly spinning massive stars to form black\nholes. Consequently, since first generation stars are expected to be very\nmassive, GRBs are likely to have occurred in significant numbers at early\nepochs. X-red is a space mission concept designed to detect these extremely\nhigh redshifted GRBs, in order to probe the nature of the first generation of\nstars and hence the time of reionisation of the early Universe. We demonstrate\nthat the gamma and x-ray luminosities of typical GRBs render them detectable up\nto extremely high redshifts (z~10-30), but that current missions such as HETE2\nand SWIFT operate outside the observational range for detection of high\nredshift GRB afterglows. Therefore, to redress this, we present a complete\nmission design from the science case to the mission architecture and payload,\nthe latter comprising three instruments, namely wide field x-ray cameras to\ndetect high redshift gamma-rays, an x-ray focussing telescope to determine\naccurate coordinates and extract spectra, and an infrared spectrograph to\nobserve the high redshift optical afterglow. The mission is expected to detect\nand identify for the first time GRBs with z > 10, thereby providing constraints\non properties of the first generation of stars and the history of the early\nUniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2005 16:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

The turbulence is driven by the\nmagneto-rotational instability. The magnetic and hydrodynamic stresses in the\nturbulence correspond to an accretion time at the midplane about equal to the\nlifetimes of T Tauri disks, while accretion in the surface layers is thirty\ntimes faster. The mixing resulting from the turbulence is also fastest in the\nsurface layers. The mixing rate is similar to the rate of radial exchange of\norbital angular momentum, so that the Schmidt number is near unity. The\nvertical spreading of a trace species is well-matched by solutions of a damped\nwave equation when the flow is horizontally-averaged. The damped wave\ndescription can be used to inexpensively treat mixing in 1-D chemical models.\nHowever, even in calculations reaching a statistical steady state, the\nconcentration at any given time varies substantially over horizontal planes,\ndue to fluctuations in the rate and direction of the transport. In addition to\nmixing species that are formed under widely varying conditions, the turbulence\nintermittently forces the nebula away from local chemical equilibrium.

Such observations would require combining an\norder of magnitude increase in collecting area over existing instruments, with\na similarly large increase in field of view for routine sky monitoring, and a\nfactor of five decrease in energy threshold to extend the visibility range to\nredshifts exceeding one. A large array of moderately sized Imaging Atmospheric\nCherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) through which the total array collecting area,\narray field of view and array data rates can be distributed, appears to be able\nto meet these requirements. To be practically feasible for construction,\nhowever, a cost effective imaging solution, with resolution of ~1 minute of arc\nwithin ~15 degrees field of view needs to be found. If image intensifier based\ntechnology provides such a solution in future, then, combined with super-fast\nparallel data processing, it may become a technological foundation for the next\nbreakthrough in ground-based gamma-ray astronomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2005 05:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, there are\ninteresting limitations to this description: the very existence of\nquasiparticles cannot be taken for granted in some systems. Like unstable\nelementary particles, quasiparticles cannot survive beyond a threshold where\ncertain decay channels become allowed by conservation laws - their spectrum\nterminates at this threshold. This regime of quasiparticle failure was first\npredicted for an exotic state of matter, super-fluid helium-4 at temperatures\nclose to absolute zero - a quantum Bose-liquid where zero-point atomic motion\nprecludes crystallization. Using neutron scattering, here we show that it can\nalso occur in a quantum magnet and, by implication, in other systems with\nBose-quasiparticles. We have measured spin excitations in a two dimensional\n(2D) quantum-magnet, piperazinium hexachlorodicuprate (PHCC) in which spin-1/2\ncopper ions form a non-magnetic quantum spin liquid (QSL), and find remarkable\nsimilarities with excitations measured in superfluid 4He. There is a threshold\nmomentum beyond which the quasiparticle peak merges with the two-quasiparticle\ncontinuum. It then acquires a finite energy width and becomes indistinguishable\nfrom a leading-edge singularity, so that lowest excited states occupy a wide\nband of energy.

The dimensionless conductance, g, and the ratio of the typical spectral\nwidth and spacing of quasimodes, \\delta, are key indicators of electronic and\nclassical wave localization when inelastic processes are absent. However, these\ncan no longer serve as localization parameters in absorbing samples since the\naffect of absorption depends upon the length of the trajectories of partial\nwaves traversing the sample, which are superposed to create the scattered\nfield. A robust determination of localization in the presence of absorption is\nfound, however, in steady-state measurements of the statistics of radiation\ntransmitted through random samples. This is captured in a single parameter, the\nvariance of the total transmission normalized to its ensemble average value,\nwhich is equal to the degree of intensity correlation of the transmitted wave,\n\\kappa. The intertwined effects of localization and absorption can also be\ndisentangled in the time domain since all waves emerging from the sample at a\nfixed time delay from an exciting pulse, t, are suppressed equally by\nabsorption. As a result, the relative weights of partial waves emerging from\nthe sample, and hence the statistics of intensity fluctuations and correlation,\nand the suppression of propagation by weak localization are not changed by\nabsorption, and manifest the growing impact of weak localization with t.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2005 14:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
