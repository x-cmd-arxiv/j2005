The\ncommonly accepted mechanism for the origin of this tensile stress is a process\ndriven by the reduction in surface energy at the expense of the strain energy\nassociated with the deformation of coalescing islands during grain boundary\nformation. In the present work, we have performed molecular statics\ncalculations using an embedded atom interatomic potential to obtain a\nfunctional form of the interfacial energy vs distance between two closely\nspaced free surfaces. The sum of interfacial energy plus strain energy provides\na measure of the total system energy as a function of island separation.\nDepending on the initial separation between islands, we find that in cases\nwhere coalescence is thermodynamically favored, gap closure can occur either\nspontaneously or be kinetically limited due to an energetic barrier. Atomistic\nsimulations of island coalescence using conjugate gradient energy minimization\ncalculations agree well with the predicted stress as a function of island size\nfrom our model of spontaneous coalescence. Molecular dynamics simulations of\nisland coalescence demonstrate that only modest barriers to coalescence can be\novercome at room temperature.

From the point of view of first quantized\ntheories, we are specifically interested in appointing the differences between\nchirality and helicity by obtaining their dynamic equations for a fermionic\nDirac-type particle (neutrino). We also identify both effects when the\nnon-minimal coupling with an external (electro)magnetic field in the neutrino\ninteracting Lagrangian is taken into account. We demonstrate that, however,\nthere is no constraint between chiral oscillations, when it takes place in\nvacuum, and the process of spin flipping related to the helicity quantum\nnumber, which does not take place in vacuum. To conclude, we show that the\norigin of chiral oscillations (in vacuum) can be interpreted as position very\nrapid oscillation projections onto the longitudinal direction of momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2005 17:16:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 10:49:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2013 18:23:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-07"}

For a large deformation with cracking, they are combined together.\nSo, for complicated deformation, a formulation to express the evolution of\ndeformation from elastic to flow will help to understand the intrinsic relation\namong the related parameters which relate the deformation with a stress field.\nTo this purpose, Eringen polar decomposition and Trusedell polar decomposition\nare formulated by explicit formulation of displacement field, based on Chen\nadditive decomposition of deformation gradient. Then the strain introduced by\nthe multiplicative decomposition and the strain introduced by the additive\ndecomposition are formulated explicitly with displacement gradient. This\nformulation clears the intrinsic contents of strains defined by taking the\nEringen polar decomposition and Trusedell polar decomposition. After that, it\nshows that the plastic deformation can be expressed as the irreversible local\naverage rotation. For initial isotropic simple elastic material, the\npath-dependent feature of classical plasticity theory is naturally expressed in\nChen strain definition. It is founded that for initially isotropic material the\nmotion equations require a non-symmetric stress for dynamic deformation and a\nsymmetric stress for static deformation. This controversy between dynamic\ndeformation and static deformation can be used to explain the cracking or\nbuckling of solid continuum. Finally, the research shows that the flow motion\nof continuum can be expressed by the same formulation system. So, it forms an\nevolution theory from elastic deformation to flow of continuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2005 09:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
