We propose NDC of supercooled superconductors to be used as an\nactive medium for generation of electric oscillations. Such generators can be\nused in the superconducting electronics as a new type THz source of radiation.\nOscillations can be modulated by the change of the bias voltage, electrostatic\ndoping by a gate electrode when the superconductor is the channel of a field\neffect transistor, or by light. When small amplitude oscillations are\nstabilized near the critical temperature T_c the generator can be used as a\nbolometer.

The model permits a simple method of\nsystematically fixing bounds on the maximum possible mass of cold compact stars\nwith a given value of radius or central density or surface density. The\nrelevant equations of state are also determined. Although simple, the model is\ncapable of describing the general features of the recently observed very\ncompact stars. For the calculation, no prior knowledge of the equation of state\n(EOS) is required. This is in contrast to the earlier calculations for maximum\nmass which were done by choosing first the relevant EOSs and using those to\nsolve the TOV equation with appropriate boundary conditions. The bounds\nobtained by us are comparable and, in some cases, more restrictive than the\nearlier results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2005 13:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
