Phase\nmeasurements in relatively large quantum dots (QDs) recently demonstrated a\nuniversal like phase evolution independent of dot size, shape, and occupancy.\nExplicitly, in Coulomb blockaded QDs the transmission phase increased\nmonotonically by pi throughout each conductance peak, thereafter, in the\nconductance valleys the phase returned sharply to its base value. Expected\nmesoscopic features in the phase, related to spin degeneracy or to exchange\neffects, were never observed. Presently, there is no satisfactory full\nexplanation for the observed phase universality. Unfortunately, the phase in a\nfew-electron QDs, where it can be better understood was never measured. Here we\nreport on such measurements on a small QD that occupy only 1-20 electrons. Such\ndot was embedded in one arm of a two path electron interferometer, with an\nelectron counter near the dot. Unlike the repetitive behavior found in larger\ndots we found now mesoscopic features for dot occupation of less than some 10\nelectrons. An unexpected feature in this regime is a clear observation of the\noccupation of two different orbital states by the first two electrons -\ncontrary to the recent publications. As the occupation increased the phase\nevolved and turned universal like for some 14 electrons and higher. The present\nmeasurements allowed us to determine level occupancy and parity. More\nimportantly, they suggest that QDs go through a phase transition, from\nmesoscopic to universal like behavior, as the occupancy increases. These\nmeasurements help in singling out potential few theoretical models among the\nmany proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2005 11:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In this approximation the outgoing gravitational\nwaves at infinity and downgoing gravitational waves at the holes' horizons are\nreplaced by standing waves so as to guarantee that the spacetime has a helical\nKilling vector field. Because the horizon generators will not, in general, be\ntidally locked to the holes' orbital motion, the standing waves will destroy\nthe horizons, converting the black holes into naked singularities that resemble\nblack holes down to near the horizon radius. This paper uses a spherically\nsymmetric, scalar-field model problem to explore in detail the following BBH\nissues: (i) The destruction of a horizon by the standing waves. (ii) The\naccuracy with which the resulting naked singularity resembles a black hole.\n(iii) The conversion of the standing-wave spacetime (with a destroyed horizon)\ninto a spacetime with downgoing waves by the addition of a ``radiation-reaction\nfield''. (iv) The accuracy with which the resulting downgoing waves agree with\nthe downgoing waves of a true black-hole spacetime (with horizon). The model\nproblem used to study these issues consists of a Schwarzschild black hole\nendowed with spherical standing waves of a scalar field. It is found that the\nspacetime metric of the singular, standing-wave spacetime, and its\nradiation-reaction-field-constructed downgoing waves are quite close to those\nfor a Schwarzschild black hole with downgoing waves -- sufficiently close to\nmake the BBH quasistationary approximation look promising for\nnon-tidally-locked black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2005 06:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The use of the\nantithetic principle in the Monte Carlo literature typically employs two strata\nvia antithetic quantile coupling. We demonstrate here that further\nstratification, obtained by using k>2 (e.g., k=3-10) antithetically coupled\nvariates, can offer substantial additional gain in Monte Carlo efficiency, in\nterms of both variance and bias. The reason for reduced bias is that\nantithetically coupled chains can provide a more dispersed search of the state\nspace than multiple independent chains. The emerging area of perfect simulation\nprovides a perfect setting for implementing the k-process parallel antithetic\ncoupling for MCMC because, without antithetic coupling, this class of methods\ndelivers genuine independent draws. Furthermore, antithetic backward coupling\nprovides a very convenient theoretical tool for investigating antithetic\nforward coupling. However, the generation of k>2 antithetic variates that are\nnegatively associated, that is, they preserve negative correlation under\nmonotone transformations, and extremely antithetic, that is, they are as\nnegatively correlated as possible, is more complicated compared to the case\nwith k=2.

In particular, it is shown that two ``fully\nnontrivial'' $n$-qubit observables are compatible locally and globally if and\nonly if they are equal up to sign. In addition, the formula gives insight into\nthe construction of new paradoxes of the type of the Kochen-Specker Theorem,\nwhich can then be easily rephrased into proposals for new no hidden variable\nexperiments of the type of the ``Bell Theorem without inequalities''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2005 13:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-30"}
