However, the details of the Hagedorn transition turn out to depend\ncritically on the precise manner in which a zero-temperature string theory is\nextrapolated to finite temperature. In this paper, we argue that for broad\nclasses of closed string theories, the traditional Hagedorn transition is\ncompletely absent when the correct extrapolation is used. However, we also\nargue that there is an alternative ``re-identified'' Hagedorn transition which\nis triggered by the thermal winding excitations of a different, ``effective''\ntachyonic string ground state. These arguments allow us to re-identify the\nHagedorn temperature for heterotic strings. Moreover, we find that all\ntachyon-free closed string models in ten dimensions share the same (revised)\nHagedorn temperature, resulting in a universal Hagedorn temperature for both\nType II and heterotic strings.

I study the properties of this adaptive detection\nscheme by considering the problem of classical information content of ensembles\nof coherent states. Using simulations of quantum trajectories and\nvisualizations of corresponding measurement operators, I show that the proposed\nmeasurement scheme adapts itself to the features of each ensemble. For all\nconsidered ensembles of coherent states, it consistently outperforms heterodyne\ndetection and Wiseman's adaptive scheme for phase measurements [H.M. Wiseman,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 75, 4587 (1995)].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2005 02:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
