In particular, virial equilibrium configurations with constant\nanisotropy parameters are studied with more detail, including both flattened\nand elongated, triaxial configurations, and the determination of the related\nbifurcation points. The explicit expression of different rotation parameters is\nalso determined. An application is made to dark matter haloes hosting giant,\ngalaxies, with regard to assigned initial and final configuration, following\nand generalizing to many respects a procedure conceived by Thuan & Gott (1975).\nThe dependence of the limiting axis ratios, below which no configuration is\nallowed for the sequence under consideration, on the change in mass, total\nenergy, and angular momentum, during the evolution, is illustrated in some\nrepresentative situations. The dependence of axis ratios and rotation\nparameters on an additional parameter, related to the initial conditions of the\ndensity perturbation, is analysed in connection with a few special cases.\nWithin the range of Peebles (1969) rotation parameter, inferred from\nhigh-resolution numerical simulations, the shape of dark matter haloes is\nmainly decided by the amount of anisotropy in residual velocity distribution.\nOn the other hand, the contribution of rotation has only a minor effect on the\nmeridional plane, and no effect on the equatorial plane, as bifurcation points\noccur for larger values of Peebles (1969) rotation parameter. To this respect,\ndark matter haloes are found to resemble giant elliptical galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 May 2005 10:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

As it has become apparent that both TFs and TFBSs are highly variable,\ntools are needed to quantify the strength of the interaction resulting from a\ncertain TF variant binding to a certain TFBS. We used a simple way to predict\ninteractions between protein and DNA: given experimental cases from the\nliterature where the interaction strength between two sequences has been\nquantified, we created training vectors for rule induction by regarding each\namino acid and nucleotide position as a single feature in the example vector.\nThe resulting interaction strength was used as the target class or value. These\ntraining vectors were then used to build a rule induction model. We applied the\nrule induction method to three protein families - transcription factors from\nthe NF-kappaB, the early-growth-response (EGR), and the paired domain groups -\nand their corresponding DNA targets. These three prediction problems increase\nin complexity with regard to model building, and thus gave us a good range for\nvalidation. The main focus of the study was the most complex problem: paired\ndomain-DNA binding. For this problem, we also found sequence/binding strength\ncorrelations using measures from information theory.
