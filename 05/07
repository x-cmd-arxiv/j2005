The\nzeroes of the smallest eigenvalue and the direction of the relative eigenvector\ncharacterize the instability uniquely. We explicitly compute three different\nclasses of examples. For a symmetrical binary mixture, analytical calculations,\nboth for mMSA and for PY, predict that when the strength of adhesiveness\nbetween like particles is smaller than the one between unlike particles, only a\npure condensation spinodal exists; in the opposite regime, a pure demixing\nspinodal appears at high densities. We then compare the mMSA and PY results for\na mixture where like particles interact as hard spheres (HS) and unlike\nparticles as SHS, and for a mixture of HS in a SHS fluid. In these cases, even\nthough the mMSA and PY spinodals are quantitatively and qualitatively very\ndifferent from each other, we prove that they have the same kind of\ninstabilities. Finally, we study the mMSA solution for five different mixtures\nobtained by setting the stickiness parameters equal to five different functions\nof the hard sphere diameters.

The procedure\nyields the exact solution for the Green's function, which describes the\nscattering of monochromatic radiation injected into the column from a source\nlocated near the surface of the star. Collisions between the injected photons\nand the infalling electrons cause the radiation to gain energy as it diffuses\nthrough the gas and gradually escapes by passing through the walls of the\ncolumn. The presence of the shock enhances the energization of the radiation\nand creates a power-law spectrum at high energies, which is typical for a Fermi\nprocess.

This paper proposes that the directionality\nof time arises from the intrinsic computational complexity of molecular\ndynamics. In particular, the following question about a hard sphere gas is\nproven to be Np-complete: Given a set of input signals, in which TRUE is\nrepresented by an actual sphere trajectory and FALSE is represented by a\ntrajectory that is not followed because an input signal is not TRUE; a set of\n'routing' spheres that follow the same trajectory for all choices of input\nsignals and that collide with the signal trajectories at pre-specified points;\ndoes there exist a set of inputs that would produce a specified final\nconfiguration?
