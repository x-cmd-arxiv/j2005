We found that the type classification of detected supernovae down to\nthe magnitude of I_{AB} ~ 27 is essential, to get useful constraint on beta.\nThe parameter tau_{Ia} can also be constrained within an accuracy of ~ 1--2\nGyr, without knowing alpha that is somewhat degenerate with tau_{Ia}.

Since these defects act as scattering centers in electron transport\nand thus limit the electronic mean free path (EMFP), high-temperature annealing\nshould lengthen the EMFP. This is based on the previous experiments in which\nannealing eliminated structural defects in various carbon materials including\nnanotubes. In this study, we investigate how high-temperature annealing affects\nthe transport properties, especially EMFP, of CVD-grown MWNTs. To measure the\nEMFP of a nanotube, we submerged samples into liquid mercury (Hg) and measured\nthe variation in conductance. We found that the EMFP is much longer in\nnanotubes annealed at 2700oC compared with that of as-produced ones. The\nannealed nanotubes show quasi-ballistic electronic transport with the EMFP\nreaching a few microns, even at room temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2005 05:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Assuming the observational\nevidence is reliable, and not the result of an unknown systematic effect, a\nviolation of the Weak Principle of Equivalence is implied. To propose an\nadditional force fails to satisfy this constraint. This paper presents a new\nhypothesis involving additional field energy in the form of: a finite number of\nlunar sourced constant amplitude (Lorentz invariant) wave-like undulations upon\nthe gravitational field. Although apparently a futile suggestion, the author's\nmodel overcomes concerns regarding wave dissipation, wave generation, and the\napparent constancy of the anomaly. A shortfall in motion arises because a tiny\nproportion of spacecraft kinetic energy is directed into a superposition of\nnon-translational longitudinal oscillatory components. The restriction of this\neffect to low mass bodies is also addressed. Additionally, the annual residual\nof the Pioneer anomaly may be attributed to a real 356 day Callisto-Titan wave\nresonance. This hypothesis may also be readily applied to other solar system\nanomalies including: the Earth flyby anomaly, an apparent absence of small\ncomets, an apparent paucity of smaller bodies in the Main Belt of asteroids,\nand residual doubts concerning the migrating planets hypothesis that addresses\nthe too rapid formation of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2005 09:08:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 May 2005 13:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This\nproof finally establishes the fact that the moduli space of the BPS domain wall\nsolution is CP^(N_f-1) for the gauge theory at finite gauge couplings.\nTherefore the moduli space at finite gauge couplings is topologically the same\nmanifold as that at infinite gauge coupling, where the gauged linear sigma\nmodel reduces to a nonlinear sigma model. The proof is extended to the U(Nc)\ngauge theory with Nf hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation,\nprovided the moduli matrix of the domain wall solution is U(1)-factorizable.\nThus the dimension of the moduli space of U(Nc) gauge theory is bounded from\nbelow by the dimension of the U(1)-factorizable part of the moduli space. We\nalso obtain sharp estimates of the asymptotic exponential decay which depend on\nboth the gauge coupling and the hypermultiplet mass differences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2005 11:25:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2005 00:29:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2006 07:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

We extend a previous analysis by\nPhoenix and Knight (S. J. D. Phoenix, P. L. Knight, Annals of Physics 186,\n381). of the JCM by considering mixed states of both the light and matter. We\npresent examples of qualitatively different entropic correlations. In\nparticular, we explore the regime of entropy exchange between light and matter,\ni.e. where the rate of change of the two are anti-correlated. This behavior\ncontrasts with the case of pure light-matter states in which the rate of change\nof the two entropies are positively correlated and in fact identical. We give\nan analytical derivation of the anti-correlation phenomenon and discuss the\nregime of its validity. Finally, we show a strong correlation between the\nregion of the Bloch sphere characterized by entropy exchange and that\ncharacterized by minimal entanglement as measured by the negative eigenvalues\nof the partially transposed density matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2005 09:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
