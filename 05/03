Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in\nregions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing\nlengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole\nexpansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm,\nwhere only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while\nlong-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is\nbased on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can\nbe integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range\ntimesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the\nparallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high\nflexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are\ncut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required\ncommunication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological\nN-body simulation with more than 10^10 dark matter particles, reaching a\nhomogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10^5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has\nalso been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that\naccount for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle\nnumbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code\nand discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems.\nGADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2005 18:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Thus 3C401 shows a new type of jet which has\nintermediate spectral properties between those of FRI, which are dominated by\nsynchrotron emission up to X-ray energies, and FRII/QSO, which show a strong\nhigh-energy emission due to inverse-Compton scattering of external photons.\nThis might be a clue for the presence of a continuous ``sequence'' in the\nproperties of large scale jets, in analogy with the ``blazar sequence'' already\nproposed for sub-pc scale jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2005 19:48:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 May 2005 20:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

For the treatment of final-state interactions (FSI) we rely on two\nframeworks succesfully applied to exclusive electron-nucleus scattering: a\nrelativistic optical potential and a relativistic multiple-scattering Glauber\napproximation. At lower energies, the optical-potential approach is considered\nto be the optimum choice, whereas at high energies a Glauber approach is more\nnatural. Comparing the results of both calculations, it is found that the\nGlauber approach yields valid results down to the remarkably small nucleon\nkinetic energies of 200 MeV. We argue that the nuclear transparencies extracted\nfrom A(e,e'p) measurements can be used to obtain realistic estimates of the\neffect of FSI mechanisms on quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections. We\npresent two independent relativistic plane-wave impulse approximation (RPWIA)\ncalculations of quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections. They agree at\nthe percent level, showing the reliability of the numerical techniques adopted\nand providing benchmark RPWIA results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2005 09:41:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2006 13:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
