In magnetic fields, higher order quantum\nprocesses such as Compton scattering become resonant at the cyclotron frequency\nand its harmonics, with the resonances being formally divergent.

Multi-epoch\nspectropolarimetry on four targets reveals variability in their intrinsic\npolarization. Three of these, AG Car, HR Car and P Cyg, show a position angle\n(PA) of polarization which appears random with time. Such behaviour can be\nexplained by the presence of strong wind-inhomogeneities, or `clumps' within\nthe wind. Only one star, R 127, shows variability at a constant PA, and hence\nevidence for axi-symmetry as well as clumpiness. However, if viewed at low\ninclination, and at limited temporal sampling, such a wind would produce a\nseemingly random polarization of the type observed in the other three stars.\nTime-resolved spectropolarimetric monitoring of LBVs is therefore required to\ndetermine if LBV winds are axi-symmetric in general.\n  The high fraction of LBVs ($>$ 50%) showing intrinsic polarization is to be\ncompared with the lower $\\sim$ 20-25 % for similar studies of their\nevolutionary neighbours, O supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars.

In our study of the Hall effect we determine a metallic\ncarrier density for all samples, and a temperature dependence of the Hall\nconstant which is inconsistent with the Skew scattering prediction. The\nmagnetoresistive response is very small and characteristic for spin disorder\nscattering, suggesting that overall the resistivity is controlled mostly by\nnonmagnetic scattering processes. We discuss possible sources for the\ntemperature and field dependence of the transport properties, in particular\nwith respect to quantum criticality and electronic localization effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2005 12:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In terms\nof CVPQC we naturally define a \"maximally\" mixed state in phase space together\nwith its explicit construction and show that for increasing number of\nencryption operations (which sets the length of a shared key between Alice and\nBob) the encrypted state is arbitrarily close to the maximally mixed state in\nthe sense of the Hilbert-Schmidt distance. We bring the exact solution for the\ndistance dependence and give also a rough estimate of the necessary number of\nbits of the shared secret key (i.e. how much classical resources are needed for\nan approximate encryption of a generally unknown continuous-variable state).\nThe definition of the CVPQC is analyzed from the Holevo bound point of view\nwhich determines an upper bound of information about an incoming state an\neavesdropper is able to get from his optimal measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2005 17:49:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2005 18:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
