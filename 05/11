For the general situation where\ncrystals are under constant external stress, we derived dynamical equations of\nthe period vectors in the framework of Newtonian dynamics, for pair potentials\nrecently (doi:/10.1139/cjp-2014-0518). The derived dynamical equations show\nthat the period vectors are driven by the imbalance between the internal and\nexternal stresses. This presents a physical process where when the external\nstress changes, the crystal structure changes accordingly, since the original\ninternal stress can not balance the external stress. The internal stress has\nboth a full kinetic energy term and a full interaction term. It is extended to\nmany-body interactions in this paper.

Even in the one-dimensional case, the penetrable-rod model\nis far from trivial, since interactions are not restricted to nearest neighbors\nand so its exact solution is not known. In this paper we first derive the exact\ncorrelation functions of penetrable-rod fluids to second order in density at\nany temperature, as well as in the high-temperature and zero-temperature limits\nat any density. Next, two simple analytic theories are constructed: a\nhigh-temperature approximation based on the exact asymptotic behavior in the\nlimit $T\\to\\infty$ and a low-temperature approximation inspired by the exact\nresult in the opposite limit $T\\to 0$.

From this starting point we\nanalyse in which way these results may give us the opportunity to gain a better\nunderstanding in the thermodynamics of ordinary systems for which a\npre-relativistic description is sufficient. First, we investigated the\npossibility to introduce an alternative definition of the entropy basically\nrelated to a local definition of the order in a spacetime model rather than a\ncounting of microstates. We show that such an alternative approach exists and\nleads to the traditional results provided an equilibrium condition is assumed.\nThis condition introduces a relation between a time interval and the reverse of\nthe temperature. We show that such a relation extensively used in the black\nhole theory, mainly as a mathematical trick, has a very general and physical\nmeaning here; in particular its derivation is not related to the existence of a\ncanonical density matrix. Our dynamical approach of thermodynamic equilibrium\nallows us to establish a relation between action and entropy and we show that\nan identical relation exists in the case of black holes. The derivation of such\na relation seems impossible in the Gibbs ensemble approach of statistical\nthermodynamics. From these results we suggest that the definition of entropy in\nterms of order in spacetime should be more general that the Boltzmann one based\non a counting of microstates. Finally we point out that these results are\nobtained by reversing the traditional route going from the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation to statistical thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2005 15:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Using a simple model, we investigate\nhow such a relational quantum theory naturally arises by promoting reference\nsystems to the status of dynamical entities. Our goal is to demonstrate using\nelementary quantum theory how any quantum mechanical experiment admits a purely\nrelational description at a fundamental level, from which the original\n\"non-relational\" theory emerges in a semi-classical limit. According to this\nthesis, the non-relational theory is therefore an approximation of the\nfundamental relational theory. We propose four simple rules that can be used to\ntranslate an \"orthodox\" quantum mechanical description into a relational\ndescription, independent of an external spacial reference frame or clock. The\ntechniques used to construct these relational theories are motivated by a\nBayesian approach to quantum mechanics, and rely on the noiseless subsystem\nmethod of quantum information science used to protect quantum states against\nundesired noise. The relational theory naturally predicts a fundamental\ndecoherence mechanism, so an arrow of time emerges from a time-symmetric\ntheory. Moreover, there is no need for a \"collapse of the wave packet\" in our\nmodel: the probability interpretation is only applied to diagonal density\noperators. Finally, the physical states of the relational theory can be\ndescribed in terms of \"spin networks\" introduced by Penrose as a combinatorial\ndescription of geometry, and widely studied in the loop formulation of quantum\ngravity. Thus, our simple bottom-up approach (starting from the semi-classical\nlimit to derive the fully relational quantum theory) may offer interesting\ninsights on the low energy limit of quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2005 07:40:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2005 02:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
