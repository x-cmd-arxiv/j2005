We exclude the presence of large\ncrystalline silicate grains in the coma. Because of this lack of large\ncrystalline grains combined with the fact that we do need large amorphous\ngrains to fit the emission spectrum at long wavelengths, we need only\napproximately 4% of crystalline silicates by mass. After correcting for\npossible hidden crystalline material included in large amorphous grains, our\nbest estimate of the total mass fraction of crystalline material is\napproximately 7.5%, significantly lower than deduced in previous studies in\nwhich the typical derived crystallinity is 20-30%.

Here we show that when such systems are driven with sufficiently high\ncurrent, and in liquid helium bath, a peculiar type of conductance noise can be\nobserved. This noise appears in the conductance versus time traces as\ndownward-going spikes. The characteristic features of the spikes (such as\ntypical width) and the threshold current at which they appear are controlled by\nthe sample parameters. We show that this phenomenon is peculiar to hopping\ntransport and does not exist in the diffusive regime.

A model based\non the percolative nature of hopping conductance explains why the onset of the\neffect is controlled by current density.

Roughly speaking, the triply graded theory by itself\ncaptures the large N behavior of the sl(N) homology, and differentials capture\nnon-stable behavior for small N, including knot Floer homology. The\ndifferentials themselves should come from another variant of sl(N) homology,\nnamely the deformations of it studied by Gornik, building on work of Lee.\n  While we do not give a mathematical definition of the triply graded theory,\nthe rich formal structure we propose is powerful enough to make many\nnon-trivial predictions about the existing knot homologies that can then be\nchecked directly.

The soft-core $\\pi N$-model\ngives an excellent fit to the empirical $\\pi N$ S- and P-wave phase shifts up\nto T_{lab}=600 MeV. Also the scattering lengths have been reproduced well and\nthe soft-pion theorems for low-energy $\\pi N$ scattering are satisfied. The\nsoft-core model for the $K^+ N$ interaction is an SU_f(3)-extension of the\nsoft-core $\\pi N$-model. The $K^+ N$ potential includes the t-channel exchanges\nof the scalar-mesons a_0, $\\sigma$ and f_0, vector-mesons $\\rho$, $\\omega$ and\n$\\phi$, tensor-mesons a_2, f_2 and f_2' and the Pomeron as well as u-channel\nexchanges of the hyperons $\\Lambda$ and $\\Sigma$. The fit to the empirical $K^+\nN$ S-, P- and D-wave phase shifts up to T_{lab}=600 MeV is reasonable and\ncertainly reflects the present state of the art. Since the various $K^+ N$\nphase shift analyses are not very consistent, also scattering observables are\ncompared with the soft-core $K^+ N$-model. A good agreement for the total and\ndifferential cross sections as well as the polarizations is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2005 10:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
