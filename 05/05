We show\nthat, consistent with recent numerical simulations, it is expected that mergers\nbetween neutron stars and black holes will be prompt, with no accretion disk\nand no stable mass transfer, if the black hole has a mass greater than that of\nthe neutron star and is spinning slowly. The reason is that for comparable\nmasses, angular momentum loss to gravitational radiation starts a plunge orbit\nwell outside the innermost stable circular orbit, causing direct merging rather\nthan extended mass transfer. Even when the black hole is spinning rapidly and\nexactly prograde with respect to the orbit, we show that it is possible within\ncurrent understanding that no accretion disk will form under any circumstances,\nbut resolution of this will require full general relativistic numerical\nsimulations with no approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2005 11:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The code evolves spherical gaseous shells in an expanding\nUniverse by employing a MOND-type relationship between the fluctuations in the\ndensity field and the gravitational force, $g$. We focus on the evolution of\ninitial density perturbations of the form $\\delta_{i}\\sim r_{i}^{-s}$ for\n$0<s<3$. A shell is initially cold and remains so until it encounters the shock\nformed by the earlier collapse of shells nearer to the centre. During the early\nepochs $g$ is sufficiently large and shells move according to Newtonian\ngravity. As the physical size of the perturbation increases with time, $g$ gets\nsmaller and the evolution eventually becomes MOND dominated. However, the\ndensity in the inner collapsed regions is large enough that they re-enter the\nNewtonian regime. The evolved gas temperature and density profiles tend to a\nuniversal form that is independent of the the slope, $s$, and of the initial\namplitude. An analytic explanation of this intriguing result is offered. Over a\nwide range of scales, the temperature, density and entropy profiles in the\nsimulations, depend on radius roughly like $r^{0.5}$, $r^{-1.5}$ and $r^{1.5}$,\nrespectively.

Using the geometry of such\nbow shocks information concerning the ISM density and its fluctuations can be\ngained from such infrared observations. As to help to improve the bow shock\nmodels, additional observations at other wavelengths, e.g. H-Alpha, are most\nwelcome.

Then the lowest energy topological excitation (vortex\nor persistent current) becomes a composite object consisting of $q$ circulation\nquanta of one component and one circulation of the other. In the SQUID-type\ngeometry, the value of $q$ can become fractional. These topological complexes\ncan be detected by absorptive imaging. We present both the mean field and Monte\nCarlo results.

This fact is shown to\nincrease by a factor $4\\sqrt{2}$ the absolute value of the coefficient at the\n1/R-term in the large-distance potential with respect to that of the Nambu-Goto\nstring in 3d. The string tension also acquires a positive correction, which is,\nhowever, exponentially small. At finite temperature, the matter fields of\ninterest are massless fundamental quarks, which diminish the deconfinement\ncritical temperature by way of an additional attraction of a monopole and an\nantimonopole inside their molecules through the quark zero modes. It is\ndemonstrated that, outside the BPS-limit, when the number of massless flavors\nis 4 or larger, the deconfinement phase transition occurs already at the\ntemperatures of the order of the temperature of dimensional reduction. In the\nBPS limit, this critical number of flavors is 3.
