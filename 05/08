Three\nphysically distinct regimes can be identified in the evolution of cluster\nturbulence and magnetic fields. Firstly, the fluctuation dynamo will produce\nmicrogauss-strong, random magnetic fields during cluster formation and major\nmergers. Turbulent velocity of about 300 km/s can be maintained at scales\n100-200 kpc. The magnetic field is intermittent, has a smaller scale of 20-30\nkpc and average strength of 2 microgauss. Secondly, when major mergers end,\nturbulent speed and magnetic field undergo a power-law decay, decreasing in\nstrength but increasing in scale by a factor of about two. Thirdly,\nsmaller-mass subclusters and cluster galaxies produce turbulent wakes, with\nturbulent speeds and magnetic field strengths similar to those quoted above.\nThe velocity scales are about 200 kpc and 10 kpc respectively, and the magnetic\nfield scale is about 6 times smaller. Although these wakes may fill only a\nsmall fraction of the cluster volume, their area covering factor can be close\nto unity. So one can potentially reconcile observations that indicate the\ncoexistence of turbulence with ordered filamentary gas structures, as in the\nPerseus cluster. Random Faraday rotation measure is estimated to be typically\n100-200 rad/m^2, in agreement with observations. We predict detectable\nsynchrotron polarization from cluster radio halos at wavelengths 3-6 cm, if\nobserved at sufficiently high resolution (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2005 18:07:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2005 12:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
