For nearest-neighbor interactions - corresponding to the\nKlein-Gordon case - upper and lower bounds to the degree of entanglement can be\nstated explicitly for arbitrarily shaped regions, generalizing the findings of\n[Phys.

These higher dimensional analogues of the\nanalysis of block entropies in the one-dimensional case show that under general\nconditions, one can expect an area law for the entanglement in non-critical\nharmonic many-body systems. The proofs make use of methods from entanglement\ntheory, as well as of results on matrix functions of block banded matrices.\nDisordered systems are also considered. We moreover construct a class of\nexamples for which the two-point correlation length diverges, yet still an area\nlaw can be proven to hold. We finally consider the scaling of classical\ncorrelations in a classical harmonic system and relate it to a quantum lattice\nsystem with a modified interaction.
