Based on this finding, we revisit the\nlong-standing question of whether this quasar pair is a binary quasar or a\nwide-separation lens. Previous work has shown that both quasars are at z=1.465\nand show broad absorption lines. No evidence for a lensing galaxy has been\nfound between the quasars, but there were two hints of a foreground cluster:\ndiffuse X-ray emission observed with Chandra, and an excess of faint galaxies\nobserved with the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we show, via VLT spectroscopy,\nthat there is a spike in the redshift histogram of galaxies at z=0.77. We\nestimate the chance of finding a random velocity structure of such significance\nto be about 5%, and thereby interpret the diffuse X-ray emission as originating\nfrom z=0.77, rather than the quasar redshift. The mass of the cluster, as\nestimated from either the velocity dispersion of the z=0.77 galaxies or the\nX-ray luminosity of the diffuse emission, would be consistent with the\ntheoretical mass required for gravitational lensing. The positional offset\nbetween the X-ray centroid and the expected location of the mass centroid is\nabout 40kpc, which is not too different from offsets observed in lower redshift\nclusters. However, UM425 would be an unusual gravitational lens, by virtue of\nthe absence of a bright primary lensing galaxy. Unless the mass-to-light ratio\nof the galaxy is at least 80 times larger than usual, the lensing hypothesis\nrequires that the galaxy group or cluster plays a uniquely important role in\nproducing the observed deflections.\n  Based on observations performed with the Very Large Telescope at the European\nSouthern Observatory, Paranal, Chile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2005 10:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We provide a\nthorough numerical analysis of the mean field approximation, given in QCD by\nthe Balitsky-Kovchegov equation. In the framework of a simple stochastic toy\nmodel that captures the relevant features of QCD, we discuss and illustrate the\nuniversal properties of such stochastic models. We investigate in particular\nthe validity of the mean field approximation and how it is broken by\nfluctuations. We find that the mean field approximation is a good approximation\nin the initial stages of the evolution in rapidity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2005 10:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2005 22:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In\nthe parameter space $P^{Q}$ of such maps, I considered the algebraic curves\ncorresponding to the parameters for which critical orbits are periodic, and I\ncalled such curves left and right bones.

The behavior of the\ntopological entropy function of the polynomials in my family is closely related\nto the structure of the bone-skeleton. The main conclusion of the paper is that\nthe entropy level-sets in the parameter space that was studied are connected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2005 18:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Spin precession due to\nmagnetic fields as well as their gradients and transients can be cancelled in\nthis arrangement. The sensitivity is enhanced by using a high-density\nalkali-metal vapor in a spin-exchange relaxation free (SERF) regime. With a\nK-3He co-magnetometer we demonstrate rotation sensitivity of 5 10^(-7)\nrad/sec/Hz^(1/2). The rotation signal can be increased by a factor of 10 using\n21Ne due to its smaller magnetic moment and the fundamental rotation\nsensitivity limit for a 21Ne gyroscope with a 10 cm^3 measurement volume is\nabout 2 10^(-10) rad/sec/Hz^(1/2).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2005 15:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

By this process not only the relativistic world follows most\nnaturally but I would like to conjecture that if Einstein were born in 1844 (or\nhad I been born in 1844 and had followed this line of thought as I do now!) it\nwould have in fact been predicted including existence of a wave with universal\nconstant velocity. That would have indeed been not only the greatest but most\namazing and remarkable feat of human thought.\n  Beating further on the same track of principle and concept driven ideas, we\nponder over to see beyond Einstein, and ask the questions: in how many\ndimensions does gravity live, how many basic forces are there in nature and\nwhat are the basic building blocks of space-time?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2005 15:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To this\npurpose, recently, we have proposed a model based on a coarse graining\ndescription, which describes the protein as a network of elementary impedances.\nThe network is built from the knowledge of the positions of the C-alpha atoms\nof the amino acids, which represent the nodes of the network. Since the\nelementary impedances are taken depending of the inter-nodes distance, the\nconformational change of the receptor induced by the capture of the ligand\nresults in a variation of the network impedance. On the other hand, the\nfluctuations of the atomic positions due to thermal motion imply an impedance\nnoise, whose level is crucial to the purpose of an electrical detection of the\nligand capture by the GPCR. Here, in particular, we address this issue by\npresenting a computational study of the impedance noise due to thermal\nfluctuations of the atomic positions within a rhodopsin molecule. In our model,\nthe C-alpha atoms are treated as independent, isotropic, harmonic oscillators,\nwith amplitude depending on the temperature and on the position within the\nprotein (alpha-helix or loop). The relative fluctuation of the impedance is\nthen calculated for different temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2005 08:59:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 May 2005 07:43:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2005 10:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

However, much of the confusion may\nstem from inappropriate comparisons using formal analyses. In contrast, our\nstarting point here is that a complete dynamical description requires a full\nunderstanding of the evolution of measured systems, necessary to explain actual\nexperimental results. This is of course true, both classically and quantum\nmechanically. Because the evolution of the physical state is now conditioned on\nmeasurement results, the dynamics of such systems is intrinsically nonlinear\neven at the level of distribution functions. Due to this feature, the\nphysically more complete treatment reveals the existence of dynamical regimes\n-- such as chaos -- that have no direct counterpart in the linear (unobserved)\ncase. Moreover, this treatment allows for understanding how an effective\nclassical behavior can result from the dynamics of an observed quantum system,\nboth at the level of trajectories as well as distribution functions. Finally,\nwe have the striking prediction that time-series from measured quantum systems\ncan be chaotic far from the classical regime, with Lyapunov exponents differing\nfrom their classical values. These predictions can be tested in next-generation\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2005 18:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
