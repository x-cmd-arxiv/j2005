The growth of bulges and black holes can commonly\nproceed through external gas accretion or hierarchical mergers, and are both\nrelated to starbursts. Internal dynamical processes control and regulate the\nrate of mass accretion. Self-regulation and feedback are the key of the\ncorrelation. It is possible that the growth of one component, either BH or\nbulge, takes over, breaking the correlation, as in Narrow Line Seyfert 1\nobjects. The formation of supermassive black holes can begin early in the\nuniverse, from the collapse of Population III, and then through gas accretion.\nThe active black holes can then play a significant role in the re-ionization of\nthe universe. The nuclear activity is now frequently invoked as a feedback to\nstar formation in galaxies, and even more spectacularly in cooling flows. The\ngrowth of SMBH is certainly there self-regulated. SMBHs perturb their local\nenvironment, and the mergers of binary SMBHs help to heat and destroy central\nstellar cusps. The interpretation of the X-ray background yields important\nconstraints on the history of AGN activity and obscuration, and the census of\nAGN at low and at high redshifts reveals the downsizing effect, already\nobserved for star formation. History appears quite different for bright QSO and\nlow-luminosity AGN: the first grow rapidly at high z, and their number density\ndecreases then sharply, while the density of low-luminosity objects peaks more\nrecently, and then decreases smoothly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2005 17:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

To\nunderstand recent experimental results, we use the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii\nequations and the generalized nonlinear sigma model. An axisymmetric vortex\nstate, which was observed by the JILA group, can be regarded as a topologically\ntrivial skyrmion in the pseudospin representation. The internal, coherent\ncoupling between the two components breaks the axisymmetry of the vortex state,\nresulting in a stable vortex molecule (a meron pair).

The lower bounds on the density\nof arbitrary parity-check matrices are expressed in terms of the gap between\nthe rate of these codes for which reliable communication is achievable and the\nchannel capacity, and the bounds are valid for every sequence of binary linear\nblock codes. These bounds address the question, previously considered by Sason\nand Urbanke, of how sparse can parity-check matrices of binary linear block\ncodes be as a function of the gap to capacity. Similarly to a previously\nreported bound by Sason and Urbanke, the new lower bounds on the parity-check\ndensity scale like the log of the inverse of the gap to capacity, but their\ntightness is improved (except for a binary symmetric/erasure channel, where\nthey coincide with the previous bound). The new upper bounds on the achievable\nrates of binary linear block codes tighten previously reported bounds by\nBurshtein et al., and therefore enable to obtain tighter upper bounds on the\nthresholds of sequences of binary linear block codes under ML decoding. The\nbounds are applied to low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, and the\nimprovement in their tightness is exemplified numerically. The upper bounds on\nthe achievable rates enable to assess the inherent loss in performance of\nvarious iterative decoding algorithms as compared to optimal ML decoding. The\nlower bounds on the asymptotic parity-check density are helpful in assessing\nthe inherent tradeoff between the asymptotic performance of LDPC codes and\ntheir decoding complexity (per iteration) under message-passing decoding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2005 07:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}
