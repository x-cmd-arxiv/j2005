The focus is primarily on\nBi2Sr2CaCu2O8, the material on which most STM measurements of impurity\nresonances in the superconducting state have been performed. The magnitudes of\nthe effective potentials found for Zn, Ni and vacancies on the in-plane Cu\nsites in this host material are remarkably consistent with phenomenological\nfits of potential scattering models to STM resonance energies. The effective\npotential ranges are quite short, of order 1 A with weak long range tails, in\ncontrast to some current models of extended potentials which attempt to fit STM\ndata. For the case of Zn and Cu vacancies, the effective potentials are\nstrongly repulsive, and states on the impurity site near the Fermi level are\nsimply removed. The local density of states (LDOS) just above the impurity is\nnevertheless found to be a maximum in the case of Zn and a local minimum in\ncase of the vacancy, in agreement with experiment. The Zn and Cu vacancy\npatterns are explained as due to the long-range tails of the effective impurity\npotential at the sample surface. The case of Ni is richer due to the Ni atom's\nstrong hybridization with states near the Fermi level; in particular, the short\nrange part of the potential is attractive, and the LDOS is found to vary\nrapidly with distance from the surface and from the impurity site. We propose\nthat the current controversy surrounding the observed STM patterns can be\nresolved by properly accounting for the effective impurity potentials and\nwave-functions near the cuprate surface.

However, recent technological advances (particularly on\nminiaturized semiconductor devices and nanoscale objects) have made it possible\nto envisage practical applications of plasma physics where the quantum nature\nof the particles plays a crucial role. Here, I shall review different\napproaches to the modeling of quantum effects in electrostatic collisionless\nplasmas. The full kinetic model is provided by the Wigner equation, which is\nthe quantum analog of the Vlasov equation. The Wigner formalism is particularly\nattractive, as it recasts quantum mechanics in the familiar classical phase\nspace, although this comes at the cost of dealing with negative distribution\nfunctions. Equivalently, the Wigner model can be expressed in terms of $N$\none-particle Schr{\\\"o}dinger equations, coupled by Poisson's equation: this is\nthe Hartree formalism, which is related to the `multi-stream' approach of\nclassical plasma physics. In order to reduce the complexity of the above\napproaches, it is possible to develop a quantum fluid model by taking\nvelocity-space moments of the Wigner equation. Finally, certain regimes at\nlarge excitation energies can be described by semiclassical kinetic models\n(Vlasov-Poisson), provided that the initial ground-state equilibrium is treated\nquantum-mechanically. The above models are validated and compared both in the\nlinear and nonlinear regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2005 15:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
