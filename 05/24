Each agent\npicks the momentarily best-performing strategy for decision with the\nperformance of the strategy being a result of the cumulative collective\ndecisions of the agents. The agents may or may not be networked for information\nsharing. Detailed numerical simulations reveal that the system exhibits\nwell-defined plateaux regions in the success rate which are separated from each\nother by abrupt transitions. As $L$ increases, the maximum success rate forms a\nwell defined sequence of simple fractions. We analyze the features by studying\nthe outcome time series, the dynamics of the strategies' performance ranking\npattern and the dynamics in the history space. While the system tends to\nexplore the whole history space due to its competitive nature, an increasing\n$L$ has the effect of driving the system to a restricted portion of the history\nspace. Thus the underlying cause of the observed features is an interesting\nself-organized phenomena in which the system, in response to the global\nresource level, effectively avoids particular patterns of history outcomes.

Detection of such\noutliers is important for many applications such as fraud detection and\ncustomer migration. Most such applications are high dimensional domains in\nwhich the data may contain hundreds of dimensions. However, the outlier\ndetection problem itself is not well defined and none of the existing\ndefinitions are widely accepted, especially in high dimensional space. In this\npaper, our first contribution is to propose a unified framework for outlier\ndetection in high dimensional spaces from an ensemble-learning viewpoint. In\nour new framework, the outlying-ness of each data object is measured by fusing\noutlier factors in different subspaces using a combination function.\nAccordingly, we show that all existing researches on outlier detection can be\nregarded as special cases in the unified framework with respect to the set of\nsubspaces considered and the type of combination function used. In addition, to\ndemonstrate the usefulness of the ensemble-learning based outlier detection\nframework, we developed a very simple and fast algorithm, namely SOE1 (Subspace\nOutlier Ensemble using 1-dimensional Subspaces) in which only subspaces with\none dimension is used for mining outliers from large categorical datasets. The\nSOE1 algorithm needs only two scans over the dataset and hence is very\nappealing in real data mining applications. Experimental results on real\ndatasets and large synthetic datasets show that: (1) SOE1 has comparable\nperformance with respect to those state-of-art outlier detection algorithms on\nidentifying true outliers and (2) SOE1 can be an order of magnitude faster than\none of the fastest outlier detection algorithms known so far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2005 02:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\ncovariant superfield equation encompassing the component ones for all integer\nand half-integer massless higher spins amounts to the vanishing of covariant\nspinor derivatives of the suitable Goldstone superfields, and, via\nMaurer-Cartan equations, to the vanishing of $SL(4,R)$ supercurvature in odd\ndirections of $R^{(10|4)}$.

They cover the basic ideas of a new,\ngeometric approach to geometric measure theory. They begin with a new theory of\nexterior calculus at a single point. This infinitesimal theory extends, by\nlinearity, to a discrete exterior theory, based at finitely many points. A\ngeneral theory of calculus culminates by taking limits in Banach spaces, and is\nvalid for domains called ``chainlets'' which are defined to be elements of the\nBanach spaces. Chainlets include manifolds, rough domains (e.g., fractals),\nsoap films, foliations, and Euclidean space. Most of the work is at the level\nof the infinitesimal calculus, at a single point. The number of limits needed\nto get to the full theory is minimal. Tangent spaces are not used in these\nnotes, although they can be defined within the theory. This new approach is\nmade possible by giving the Grassmann algebra more geometric structure. As a\nresult, much of geometric measure theory is simplified. Geometry is restored\nand significant results from the classical theory are expanded. Applications\ninclude existence of solutions to a problem of Plateau, an optimal Gauss-Green\ntheorem and new models for Maxwell's equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2005 13:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Auslander in 1970 and is, due\nto spectacular recent progress, one of the most interesting homological\ninvariants in representation theory. The precise value is not known in general,\nand is very hard to compute even for small examples. For group algebras, it is\nknown in the case of cyclic Sylow subgroups, due to Auslander's fundamental\nwork. For some group algebras (in characteristic 2) of rank at least 3 the\nprecise value of the representation dimension follows from recent work of\nR.Rouquier. There is a gap for group algebras of rank 2; here the deep\ngeometric methods do not work. In this paper we show that for all n and any\nfield $k$ the commutative algebras k[x,y]/(x^2, y^{2+n}) have representation\ndimension 3.

The aim of the\nwork is to demonstrate an improvement in image spatial resolution in realistic\nnoisy radiological images with no associated penalty in terms of reduction in\nthe signal-to-noise ratio perceived by the observer. Images of the TORMAM\nmammographic image quality phantom were recorded using the standard\nmagnification settings of 1.8 magnification/fine focus and also at 1.8\nmagnification/broad focus and 3.0 magnification/fine focus; the latter two\narrangements would normally give rise to unacceptable geometric blurring.\nMeasured point-spread functions were used in conjunction with the MEM image\nprocessing to de-blur these images. The results are presented as comparative\nimages of phantom test features and as observer scores for the raw and\nprocessed images. Visualization of high resolution features and the total image\nscores for the test phantom were improved by the application of the MEM\nprocessing.
