We have previously studied the case of\nconstant distributions of specific angular momentum. In this second paper, we\ninvestigate (i) how the size of the disc affects the oscillation\neigenfrequencies, and (ii) the effect of power-law distributions of angular\nmomentum on the oscillations. In particular, we compare the oscillations of the\ndisc with the epicyclic eigenfrequencies of a test particle with different\nangular momentum distributions orbiting around the central object. We find that\nthere is a frequency shift away from the epicyclic eigenfrequency of the test\nparticle to lower values as the size of the tori is increased. We have also\nstudied the response of a thick accretion disc to a localized external\nperturbation using non constant specific angular momentum distributions within\nthe disc. We find that in this case it is also possible (as reported previously\nfor constant angular momentum distributions) to efficiently excite internal\nmodes of oscillation. In fact we show here that the local perturbations excite\nglobal oscillations (acoustic p modes) closely related to the epicyclic\noscillations of test particles. Our results are particularly relevant in the\ncontext of low mass X-ray binaries and microquasars, and the high frequency\nQuasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) observed in them. Our computations make use\nof a Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code in azimuthal symmetry, and use a\ngravitational potential that mimics the effects of strong gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2005 21:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
