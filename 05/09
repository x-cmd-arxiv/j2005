They then estimated the microlensing optical depth to the LMC\nto be between 0.3 x 10^{-7} and 0.5 x 10^{-7}, lower by about a factor of two\nthan that found by the MACHO collaboration. There has been a recent independent\nclaim of a low optical depth to the LMC by the EROS collaboration, who find\n0.15 x 10^{-7} from 3 candidates (Tisserand et al 2006). Griest & Thomas (2005)\nhave contested our calculations. Unfortunately, their paper contains a number\nof scientific misrepresentations of our work. We stand by our application of\nneural networks to microlensing searches and believe it to be a technique of\ngreat promise. Rather, the main cause of the disparity between Griest & Thomas\nand Belokurov et al. lies in the very different datasets through which these\ninvestigators look for microlensing events. We don't exclude the possibility\nthat some of our non-microlensing designations may change with access to clean\ndata. Whilst not everything is understood about the microlensing datasets\ntowards the LMC, the latest downward revisions of the optical depth means that\nGriest & Thomas' microlensing puzzle is a roughly 1 sigma effect. Efficiency\ncalculations can correct for the effects of false negatives, but they cannot\ncorrect for the effects of false positives (variable stars that are mistaken\nfor microlensing). Therefore, the best strategy in a microlensing experiment is\nto eschew a decision boundary altogether. Rather, each lightcurve should be\nassigned a probability and the microlensing rate calculated by summing over the\nprobabilities of all such lightcurves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2005 11:29:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2006 09:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The analysis of the line profiles shows that the SiO\nmolecule dominates at the highest velocities and at the highest excitation\nconditions, confirming its close association with shocks. H2S, SO2, and SO\npreferentially trace more quiescent regions than SiO, and in particular a lack\nof bright H2S emission at the highest velocities is found.

In the case of a fourth family of leptons with ordinary\nlepton hypercharge the new heavy neutrino can be a natural candidate of cold\ndark matter. We also propose theories in which the critical number of flavors\nneeded to enter the conformal window is higher than the one with fermions in\nthe two-index symmetric representation, but lower than in the walking\ntechnicolor theories with fermions only in the fundamental representation of\nthe gauge group. Due to the near conformal/chiral phase transition, we show\nthat the composite Higgs is very light compared to the intrinsic scale of the\ntechnicolor theory. For the two technicolor theory we predict the composite\nHiggs mass not to exceed 150 GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2005 04:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}
