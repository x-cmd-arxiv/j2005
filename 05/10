Galactic Black Hole (GBH) power density spectra\n(PDS) are generally complex, and dependent on spectral state. In the low/hard\nstate the high-frequency rollover in the PDS moves in a way which is not simply\nrelated to luminosity. Hence this feature can only be used as an approximate\nindicator rather than as an accurate tracer of black hole mass in AGN. The\nX-ray spectrum in the high/soft state is dominated by the disc in GBH, which is\nrather stable. We show that the PDS of the Comptonized tail in GBH can be much\nmore variable, and that it is this which should be compared to AGN due to their\nmuch lower disc temperature. This bandpass effect removes a problem in\ninterpreting the (often highly variable) Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies\nas the counterparts of the high mass accretion rate GBH. Additionally, we\nspeculate that some NLS1 (e.g. Akn 564) are counterparts of the very high\nstate. The Comptonized tail in this state is also highly variable, but with PDS\nwhich can be roughly described as band-limited noise. This shape is similar to\nthat seen in the low/hard state, so merely seeing such band-limited noise in\nthe power spectrum of an AGN does not necessarily imply low luminosity. We also\nstress that Cyg X-1, often used for comparison with AGN, is not a typical black\nhole system due to its persistent nature.

The fact that the NLS1s NGC 4051 and\nMCG-6-30-15 do appear to show a power spectrum similar to that of the high/soft\nstate of Cyg X-1 may lend observational support to theoretical speculation that\nthe Hydrogen ionization disc instability does not operate in AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2005 09:52:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2005 10:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Moreover, according to a theorem on projections of fractals,\ngalaxy angular catalogues can not be used for detecting a structure with the\nfractal dimension D>2. For this 3-d maps are required, and indeed modern\nextensive redshift-based 3-d maps have revealed the ``hidden'' fractal\ndimension of about 2, and have confirmed superclustering at scales even up to\n500 Mpc (e.g. the Sloan Great Wall). On scales, where the fractal analysis is\npossible in completely embedded spheres, a power--law density field has been\nfound. The fractal dimension D =2.2 +- 0.2 was directly obtained from 3-d maps\nand R_{hom} has expanded from 10 Mpc to scales approaching 100 Mpc.
