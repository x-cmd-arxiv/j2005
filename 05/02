Current observational measurements of\nProcyon A when combined with traditional stellar modeling only place a large\nupper limit on overshoot of alphaOV < 1.1. By carrying out a detailed pulsation\nanalysis, we further demonstrate, how p- and g-mode averaged spacings can be\nused to gain better estimates of the core size. For both p- and g-modes, the\nfrequency spacings for models without overshoot are clearly separated from the\nmodels with overshoot. In addition, measurements of the l=0 averaged small\np-mode spacings could be used to establish Procyon A's evolutionary stage. For\na fixed implementation of overshoot and under favorable circumstances, the\ng-mode spacings can be used to determine the overshoot extent to an accuracy of\n+-0.05 Hp. However, we stress that considerable confusion is added due to the\nunknown treatment of the overshoot region. This ambiguity might be removed by\nanalyzing many different stars. A simple non-local convection theory developed\nby Kuhfuss is implemented in our stellar evolution code and contrasted with the\ntraditional approaches. We show that this theory supports a moderate increase\nof the amount of convective overshoot with stellar mass of Delta(alphaOV) =\n+0.10 between 1.5 Msun and 15 Msun. This theory places an upper limit on\nProcyon A's core overshoot extent of ~0.4 Hp which matches the limit imposed by\nRoxburgh's integral criterion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2005 18:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Stellar rotation\ncauses magnetic field lines anchored at the surface to form a spiral pattern\nand magneto-rotational winds can be driven. If the structure is a magnetically\ndominated, fast MHD waves generated at the surface can propagate almost\nradially outward and cross the field lines. The propagating waves undergo\ncollisionless damping owing to interactions with particles surfing on magnetic\nmirrors that are formed by the waves themselves. The damping is especially\neffective where the angle between the wave propagation and the field lines\nbecomes moderately large ($\\sim 20$ to $80^{\\circ}$). The angle tends naturally\nto increase into this range because the field in magneto-rotational winds\ndevelops an increasingly large azimuthal component. The dissipation of the wave\nenergy produces heating and acceleration of the outflow. We show using\nspecified wind structures that this damping process can be important in both\nsolar-type stars and massive stars that have moderately large rotation rates.\nThis mechanism can play a role in coronae of young solar-type stars which are\nrapidly rotating and show X-ray luminosities much larger than the sun.

When we consider time and space\nscales such that the description of the trajectories of these bodies\n(planetesimals in the case of planetary system formation, interstellar gas and\ndust in the case of star formation, etc...) is in the shape of\nnon-differentiable curves, we obtain fractal curves of fractal dimension 2.\nContinuity and non-differentiability yield a fractal space and a symmetry\nbreaking of the differential time element which gives a doubling of the\nvelocity fields. The application of a geodesics principle leads to motion\nequations of Schrodinger-type. When we add an outside gravitational field, we\nobtain a Schrodinger-Poisson system. We give here the derivation of the\nSchrodinger equation for chaotic systems, i.e., with time scales much longer\nthan their Lyapounov chaos-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2005 14:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Recently a fixed point quantum search algorithm has been discovered,\nreferred to as the Phase-$\\pi/3$ search algorithm, which gets around this\nlimitation. While searching a database for a target state, this algorithm\nreduces the error probability from $\\epsilon$ to $\\epsilon^{2q+1}$ using $q$\noracle queries, which has since been proved to be asymptotically optimal. A\ndifferent algorithm is presented here, which has the same worst-case behavior\nas the Phase-$\\pi/3$ search algorithm but much better average-case behavior.\nFurthermore the new algorithm gives $\\epsilon^{2q+1}$ convergence for all\nintegral $q$, whereas the Phase-$\\pi/3$ search algorithm requires $q$ to be\n$(3^{n}-1)/2$ with $n$ a positive integer. In the new algorithm, the operations\nare controlled by two ancilla qubits, and fixed point behavior is achieved by\nirreversible measurement operations applied to these ancillas. It is an example\nof how measurement can allow us to bypass some restrictions imposed by\nunitarity on quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2005 15:29:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 May 2005 21:31:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2006 01:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
