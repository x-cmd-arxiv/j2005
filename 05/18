While it has been known\nthat the size of the planetary caustic is \\propto \\sqrt{q}, we find from this\nwork that the dependence of the size of the central caustic on $q$ is linear,\ni.e., \\propto q, implying that the central caustic shrinks much more rapidly\nwith the decrease of $q$ compared to the planetary caustic.

We use new optical spectra taken with the WHT to make a detailed\ncomparison of the kinematics of the neutral hydrogen with that of the ionised\ngas. The striking similarity between the complex kinematics of the two gas\nphases suggests that both the ionised gas and the neutral gas are part of the\nsame outflow.

The most likely interpretation is that the radio jet ionises the ISM\nand accelerates it to the high outflow velocities observed. Our observations\ndemonstrate that, following this strong jet-cloud interaction, not all gas\nclouds are destroyed and that part of the gas can cool and become neutral. The\nmass outflow rate measured in 3C~305 is comparable, although at the lower end\nof the distribution, to that found in Ultra-Luminous IR galaxies.

In low-mass (< 10^6 M_sun) halos, the stellar radiation\nsignificantly reduces the ambient gas density prior to the SN explosion. The\nblastwave quickly propagates over the halo's virial radius, leading to complete\nevacuation of the gas even with the input energy of 10^50 erg.

By tracing the chemical\nevolution of the intracluster gas, which is polluted by two generations of\nstars, we are able to test the internal pollution scenario in which the Na- and\nAl-enhanced ejecta from intermediate mass stars is either accreted onto the\nsurfaces of other stars, or goes toward forming new stars.\n  In this paper we focus mainly on the nucleosynthetic yields of the AGB stars\nand discuss whether these stars are the source of the observed Na-O\nanticorrelation. Comparing our preliminary results with observational data\nsuggests that the qualitative theory is not supported by this quantitative\nstudy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2005 14:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

These lectures, which contain a number of previously\nunpublished results, and are intended for experts as well as students, seek to\nexplain the physics of duality cascades. Seiberg duality is carefully\nintroduced, with detailed attention to the physical implications of duality\naway from the far infrared. The conifold is briefly introduced and strings on\nthe conifold (the Klebanov-Witten model) are discussed. Next, fractional branes\nare introduced. The duality cascade is then constructed in field theory and in\nits dual supergravity description. Among the newly published results: it is\nshown why supergravity sees the cascade as smooth; how the two holomorphic\ncouplings (dilaton and integrated two-form in supergravity) are related to the\nthree physical couplings in the gauge theory; that there are actually twice as\nmany approximate fixed points in the cascade as might be naively expected.\nThese notes are based on lectures given at TASI 2003 and at the 2003 PIMS\nSummer School on Strings, Gravity & Cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2005 17:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

Two-level atoms were assumed to interact\nwith a single mode of the cavity, and the off-resonance case was considered\n(namely the atomic transition frequency is detuned from the single mode cavity\nfrequency). We demonstrate in this paper that this case is incorrectly treated\nby these authors and we question therefore their conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2005 06:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

By describing each oscillator by a $s$-parametrized\nquasidistribution, we derive in a consistent way the final function for the\npolarization.

A special attention is given to the case where\nthe difference between the Casimir pressures at two different temperatures,\nT=300 K and T=350 K, is involved.
