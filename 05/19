In our most sophisticated models, we put stars\non realistic orbits around Sgr A*, include `slow' winds (300 km/s), and account\nfor radiative cooling. We first model only one phase `fast' stellar winds (1000\nkm/s). For wind sources fixed in space, the accretion rate is Mdot ~ 1e-5\nMsun/yr, fluctuates by < 10%, and is in a good agreement with previous models.\nIn contrast, Mdot decreases by an order of magnitude for stars following\ncircular orbits, and fluctuates by ~ 50%. Then we allow a fraction of stars to\nproduce slow winds. Much of these winds cool radiatively, forming cold clumps\nimmersed into the X-ray emitting gas. We test two orbital configurations for\nthe stars in this scenario, an isotropic distribution and two rotating discs\nwith perpendicular orientation. The morphology of cold gas is quite sensitive\nto the orbits. In both cases, however, most of the accreted gas is hot, with an\nalmost constant Mdot ~ 3e-6 Msun/yr, consistent with Chandra observations. The\ncold gas accretes in intermittent, short but powerful episodes which may give\nrise to large amplitude variability in the luminosity of Sgr A* on time scales\nof 10s to 100s of years. The circularisation radii for the flows are ~ 1e3 and\n1e4 Rsch, for the one and two-phase wind simulations, respectively, never\nforming the quasi-spherical accretion flows suggested in some previous work.\nOur work suggests that, averaged over time scales of 100s to 1000s of years,\nthe radiative and mechanical luminosity of Sgr A* may be substantially higher\nthan it is in its current state. Further improvements of the wind accretion\nmodelling of Sgr A* will rely on improved observational constraints for the\nwind properties and stellar orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2005 17:06:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2005 17:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In these galaxies, the bar has already driven\nmost of the gas within the bar to the nuclear region, where it has been\nconsumed by star formation. The median nuclear gas mass is over four times\nhigher in early type bars; since the gas consumption rate is an order of\nmagnitude higher in early type bars, early types must have significantly higher\nbar-driven inflows.

The new diagrams unveil for the first time\nthe star formation history of SagDIG.\n  We identify a small population of red horizontal branch stars, which sets the\nfirst epoch of star formation in SagDIG back to ~9-10 Gyr ago. This shows that\nSagDIG has been able to maintain a very low mean metallicity (-2.2<[Fe/H]<-1.9)\nover a 10 Gyr life time, and most importantly, that all Local Group dwarf\ngalaxies share an ancient (~10 Gyr) initial episode of star formation. Thus, at\nthe moment, IZw18 remains the only exception to this general trend, favoring\nthe so-called ``young galaxy'' scenario. However, a re-analysis of ACS\nobservations of IZw18 suggests that an older RGB population may be present also\nin IZw18.\n  We also compare the distribution of atomic hydrogen with that of stellar\npopulations of various ages. We find little correlation between stellar\npopulations older than ~1 Gyr and the HI. In particular we fail to find any\ngeneration of stars that preferentially lie within the large HI hole. We\ntherefore exclude the possibility that the SagDIG ring-like HI distribution is\nthe result of multiple supernova events. Alternative scenarios have to be\nexplored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2005 09:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The stationary conditions arise from\nthe competition between two stochastic and biased processes of breaking and\nrecovery of the elementary resistors. The fluctuations of the network\nresistance are calculated by Monte Carlo simulations which are performed for\ndifferent values of the applied current, for networks of different size and\nshape and by considering different levels of intrinsic disorder. The\ndistribution of the resistance fluctuations generally exhibits relevant\ndeviations from Gaussianity, in particular when the current approaches the\nthreshold of electrical breakdown. For two-dimensional systems we have shown\nthat this non-Gaussianity is in general related to finite size effects, thus it\nvanishes in the thermodynamic limit, with the remarkable exception of highly\ndisordered networks. For these systems, close to the critical point of the\nconductor-insulator transition, non-Gaussianity persists in the large size\nlimit and it is well described by the universal Bramwell-Holdsworth-Pinton\ndistribution. In particular, here we analyze the role of the shape of the\nnetwork on the distribution of the resistance fluctuations. Precisely, we\nconsider quasi-one-dimensional networks elongated along the direction of the\napplied current or trasversal to it. A significant anisotropy is found for the\nproperties of the distribution.

The method used for the\ncomputation of some relevant sums can be important for practical applications.\nIt is shown that the stationary solutions (libration points) can be determined\nfrom an algebraic equation of 5-th degree. If the mass of the particles is\nlarge, the outer libration points disappear. For the inner libration points the\nlimit minimal distance has been detected. If m=M is small the solution obtained\nfor the libration has as limit a solution similar to the for 3-body collinear\npoints. We have also constructed a central configuration with 2N + 1 bodies, in\nwhich N new particles, each of mass m1= m, are placed at the libration points\nof our first system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2005 07:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The properties of the\nhalf-sample mode, which is a simple and fast estimator of the mode of a\ncontinuous distribution, are studied. The half-sample mode is less sensitive to\noutliers than most other estimators of location, including many other low-bias\nestimators of the mode. Its breakdown point is one half, equal to that of the\nmedian. However, because of its finite rejection point, the half-sample mode is\nmuch less sensitive to outliers that are all either greater or less than the\nother values of the sample. This is confirmed by applying the mode estimator\nand the median to samples drawn from normal, lognormal, and Pareto\ndistributions contaminated by outliers. It is also shown that the half-sample\nmode, in combination with a robust scale estimator, is a highly robust starting\npoint for iterative robust location estimators such as Huber's M-estimator.

Even without assuming the\nexistence of deterministic particle trajectories, the resulting quantum-like\nstatistical interpretation is sufficient to predict all measurable results of\nclassical mechanics. In the classical case, the wave function that satisfies a\nlinear equation is positive, which is the main source of the fundamental\ndifference between classical and quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2005 14:39:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2005 12:20:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2006 09:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
