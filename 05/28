One such task is to estimate with\nfixed accuracy the normalized trace of a unitary operator that can be\nimplemented efficiently in a quantum circuit. We show that circuits of this\ntype generally lead to entangled states, and we investigate the amount of\nentanglement possible in such circuits, as measured by the multiplicative\nnegativity. We show that the multiplicative negativity is bounded by a\nconstant, independent of n, for all bipartite divisions of the n+1 qubits, and\nso becomes, when n is large, a vanishingly small fraction of the maximum\npossible multiplicative negativity for roughly equal divisions. This suggests\nthat the global nature of entanglement is a more important resource for quantum\ncomputation than the magnitude of the entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2005 18:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In this work I propose a new\nand direct connection between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics where\nthe quantum mechanical propagator is derived from a variational principle. I\nidentify this variational principle as a generalized form of Hamilton's\nprinciple. This proposed variational principle is unusual because the physical\nsystem is allowed to have imperfect information, i.e., there is incomplete\nknowledge of the physical state. Two distribution functionals over possible\ngeneralized momentum paths a[p(t)] and generalized coordinates paths b[q(t)]\nare defined. A generalized action is defined that corresponds to a contraction\nof a[p(t)], b[q(t)], and a matrix of the action evaluated at all possible p and\nq paths. Hamilton's principle is the extremization of the generalized action\nover all possible distributions. The normalization of the two distributions\nallows their values to be negative and they are shown to be the real and\nimaginary parts of the complex amplitude. The amplitude in the Feynman path\nintegral is shown to be an optimal vector that extremizes the generalized\naction. This formulation is also shown to be directly applicable to statistical\nmechanics and I show how irreversible behavior and the micro-canonical ensemble\nfollows immediately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2005 19:42:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 May 2005 20:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We assume\ntwo qubits are initially in Werner state or Werner-like state, and find that\nthermal environment can make two qubits become stationary nonlocality. The\nanalytical relations among average thermal photon number of the environment,\nentanglement and nonlocality of two qubits are given in details. It is shown\nthat the fraction of Bell singlet state plays a key role in the phenomenon that\nthe common thermal reservoir can enhance the entanglement of two qubits.\nMoreover, we find that the collective decay of two qubits in a thermal\nreservoir at zero-temperature can generate a stationary maximally entangled\nmixed state if only the fraction of Bell singlet state in the initial state is\nnot smaller than 2/3. It provides us a feasible way to prepare the maximally\nentangled mixed state in various physical systems such as the trapped ions,\nquantum dots or Josephson Junctions. For the case in which two qutrits\ncollectively coupled with the thermal reservoir at zero-temperature, we find\nthat the collective decay can induce the entanglement of two qutrits initially\nin the maximally mixed state. The collective decay of two qutrits can also\ninduce distillable entanglement from the initial conjectured negative partial\ntranspose bound entangled states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2005 04:37:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2008 05:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-25"}
