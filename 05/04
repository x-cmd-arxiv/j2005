At a critical rotation speed $\\Omega_h$, a central\nhole appears in the condensate, and at some faster rotation speed $\\Omega_g$,\nthe system undergoes a transition to a giant vortex state with pure\nirrotational flow. Using a time-dependent variational analysis, we study the\nbehavior of an annular condensate with a single concentric ring of vortices.\nThe transition to a giant vortex state is investigated by comparing the energy\nof the two equilibrium states (the ring of vortices and the giant vortex) and\nalso by studying the dynamical stability of small excitation modes of the ring\nof vortices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2005 18:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The earliest and most striking example of the\ncorrespondence is the conjectured duality between the energy spectrum of type\nIIB superstring theory on AdS_5 x S^5 and the operator anomalous dimensions of\nN=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. While there is a\nsubstantial amount of evidence in support of this conjecture, direct tests have\nbeen elusive. The difficulty of quantizing superstring theory in a curved\nRamond-Ramond background is compounded by the problem of computing anomalous\ndimensions for non-BPS operators in the strongly coupled regime of the gauge\ntheory. The former problem can be circumvented to some extent by taking a\nPenrose limit of AdS_5 x S^5, reducing the background to that of a pp-wave\n(where the string theory is soluble). A corresponding limit of the gauge theory\nwas discovered by Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase, who obtained successful\nagreement between a class of operator dimensions in this limit and\ncorresponding string energies in the Penrose limit. In this dissertation we\npresent a body of work based largely on the introduction of worldsheet\ninteraction corrections to the free pp-wave string theory by lifting the\nPenrose limit of AdS_5 x S^5. This provides a new class of rigorous tests of\nAdS/CFT that probe a truly quantum realm of the string theory.

Thus, new technologies need to\ndeal with more and more complexity. Several efforts have been made to deal with\nthis complexity using the concept of self-organization. However, in order to\npromote its use and understanding, we must first have a pragmatic understanding\nof complexity and self-organization. This paper presents a conceptual framework\nfor speaking about self-organizing systems. The aim is to provide a methodology\nuseful for designing and controlling systems developed to solve complex\nproblems. First, practical notions of complexity and self-organization are\ngiven. Then, starting from the agent metaphor, a conceptual framework is\npresented. This provides formal ways of speaking about \"satisfaction\" of\nelements and systems. The main premise of the methodology claims that reducing\nthe \"friction\" or \"interference\" of interactions between elements of a system\nwill result in a higher \"satisfaction\" of the system, i.e. better performance.\nThe methodology discusses different ways in which this can be achieved. A case\nstudy on self-organizing traffic lights illustrates the ideas presented in the\npaper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2005 19:23:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2005 15:28:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2006 22:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These measures are significantly better than random\nselection in identifying essential proteins in a PIN. Centrality measures based\non graph spectral properties of the network, in particular the subgraph\ncentrality, show the best performance in identifying essential proteins in the\nyeast PIN. Subgraph centrality gives important structural information about the\nrole of individual proteins and permits the selection of possible targets for\nrational drug discovery through the identification of essential proteins in the\nPIN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2005 21:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-02"}

Thus quantum nonlocality is tied to the celebrated\nno-go theorems, and these comprise a long list that includes the Kochen-Specker\nand Bell theorems, as well as elegant refinements by Mermin, Peres, Hardy, GHZ,\nand many others. Typically entanglement or carefully prepared multipartite\nsystems have been considered essential for violations of local realism and for\nunderstanding quantum nonlocality. Here we show, to the contrary, that sharp\nviolations of local realism arise almost everywhere without entanglement. The\npivotal fact driving these violations is just the noncommutativity of quantum\nobservables. We demonstrate how violations of local realism occur for arbitrary\nnoncommuting projectors, and for arbitrary quantum pure states. Finally, we\npoint to elementary tests for local realism, using single particles and without\nreference to entanglement, thus avoiding experimental loopholes and efficiency\nissues that continue to bedevil the Bell inequality related tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2005 17:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
