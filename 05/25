Thanks to the nearly immediate relay of the GRB position by\nSwift, we began imaging the GRB field 8 minutes after the burst and continued\nfor the following 8 days. No convincing optical/infrared candidate afterglow or\nsupernova was found for the object. We present a re-analysis of the XRT\nafterglow and find an absolute position that is ~4\" to the west of the XRT\nposition reported previously. Close to this position is a bright elliptical\ngalaxy with redshift z=0.2248, about 1' from the center of a rich cluster of\ngalaxies. Based on positional coincidences, the GRB and the bright elliptical\nare likely to be physically related. We thus have discovered evidence that at\nleast some short-duration, hard-spectra GRBs arise at cosmological distances.\nHowever, while GRB 050509b was underluminous compared to long-duration GRBs, we\ndemonstrate that the ratio of the blast-wave energy to the gamma-ray energy is\nconsistent with that of long-duration GRBs. Based on this analysis, on the\nlocation of the GRB (40 +- 13 kpc from a bright galaxy), on the galaxy type\n(elliptical), and the lack of a coincident supernova, we suggest that there is\nnow observational consistency with the hypothesis that short-hard bursts arise\nduring the merger of a compact binary.

Neutrino fluxes as expected from prompt charm decay in the\natmosphere or from astrophysical sources such as Active Galactic Nuclei are\nmodeled assuming power laws. The ability to measure the normalization and slope\nof these spectra is then analyzed.\n  It is found that the cascade channel generally has a high sensitivity for the\ndetection and characterization of the diffuse flux, when compared to what is\nexpected for the upgoing- and downgoing-muon channels. A flux at the level of\nthe Waxman-Bahcall upper bound should be detectable in all channels separately\nwhile a combination of the information of the different channels will allow\ndetection of a flux more than one order of magnitude lower.

The period of the radial-velocity variation is\nlonger than that of the estimated stellar rotation, rendering it unlikely that\nrotational modulation is the source of the variation in the radial velocity.\nThis hypothesis is supported by the absence of a correlation between stellar\nactivity indicators and radial-velocity variation.

It is shown that the level and character of the soft (0.2-10 keV) X-ray\nemission change drastically with cluster age and are tightly linked with\nstellar evolution. Using the modern X-ray observations of massive stars we show\nthat the correlation between bolometric and X-ray luminosity known for single O\nstars also holds for O+O and O+Wolf-Rayet (WR) binaries. The diffuse emission\noriginates from the cluster wind heated by the kinetic energy of stellar winds\nand supernova explosions. To model the evolution of the cluster wind, the mass\nand energy yields from a population synthesis are used as input to a\nhydrodynamic model. It is shown that in a very young clusters the emission from\nthe cluster wind is low. When the cluster evolves, WR stars are formed. Their\nstrong stellar winds power an increasing X-ray emission of the cluster wind.\nSubsequent supernova explosions pump the level of diffuse emission even higher.\nClusters at this evolutionary stage may have no X-ray bright stellar point\nsources, but a relatively high level of diffuse emission.

Density functional based studies reveal an\nunusual nature of its unstable (and therefore unseen) paramagnetic state, which\nfor one electron less (CuMnSn, for example) would be a zero gap semiconductor\n(accidentally so) between two sets of very narrow, topologically separate bands\nof Mn 3d character. The extremely flat Mn 3d bands result from the environment:\nMn has four tetrahedrally coordinated Cu atoms whose 3d states lie well below\nthe Fermi level, and the other four tetrahedrally coordinated sites are empty,\nleaving chemically isolated Mn 3d states. The AFM phase can be pictured\nheuristically as a self-doped Cu$^{1+}$Mn$^{2+}$Sb$^{3-}$ compensated semimetal\nwith heavy mass electrons and light mass holes, with magnetic coupling\nproceeding through Kondo and/or antiKondo coupling separately through the two\ncarrier types. The ratio of the linear specific heat coefficient and the\ncalculated Fermi level density of states indicates a large mass enhancement\n$m^*/m \\sim 5$, or larger if a correlated band structure is taken as the\nreference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2005 15:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The Theta^+ is a baryon that has\nstrangeness S=+1, meaning that it contains an anti-strange quark. Thus it\ncannot be constructed from three quarks, unlike all other known baryons; it\nneeds at least an extra quark-antiquark pair. It is usually modeled as a\npentaquark state in the 10 bar representation of flavor SU(3), with flavor\ncontent \\bar{s}uudd.\n  This thesis considers possible heavy pentaquarks, in which the antiquark is\ncharmed or bottom rather than strange. In the context of the diquark model of\nJaffe and Wilczek, it is argued that negative-parity pentaquarks of this type\nmay be lighter than their positive-parity counterparts, and hence are likely to\nbe stable against strong decay. Estimates are made for their masses, and their\nweak decays are discussed. Isospin relations are found between the decay rates\nfor different possible decay channels.\n  Negative-parity heavy pentaquarks are also considered in a less\nmodel-dependent way, in the context of a 1/N_c expansion, where N_c is the\nnumber of colors. Heavy quark effective theory is also employed. Mass relations\nare found between the mass splittings of heavy pentaquarks and those of\nnonexotic baryons, and SU(3)-breaking corrections to these relations are\ncomputed. The results could be helpful in interpreting experimental data if\nheavy pentaquarks are observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2005 22:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, in general, one cannot forecast how\nmany solutions a boundary value problem may possess or even determine the\nexistence of a solution. In recent years numerical continuation methods have\nbeen developed which permit the numerical approximation of all complex\nsolutions of systems of polynomial equations. In this paper, numerical\ncontinuation methods are adapted to numerically calculate the solutions of\nfinite difference discretizations of nonlinear two-point boundary value\nproblems. The approach taken here is to perform a homotopy deformation to\nsuccessively refine discretizations. In this way additional new solutions on\nfiner meshes are obtained from solutions on coarser meshes.

It\nis evident, that overlapping of instability zones in strongly perturbed system\ncan be a source of the chaotic behaviour. The main result of this work may be\nformulated in such form: There are not exist stable orbits with e=0 and i=0 in\nneighborhood of mean motion resonances (2n-1)/(2n+1). Positions and width of\nunstable zones depends from eccentricity. At high order of resonance, instable\nzones are overlapped. This fact can explain chaotic nature of according orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2005 04:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the West, Aristotle (384-322 BCE) is generally credited with the\nformalization of the tradition of logic and also with the development of early\nphysics. In India, the Rigveda itself in the hymn 10.129 suggests the\nbeginnings of the representation of reality in terms of various logical\ndivisions that were later represented formally as the four circles of: \"A\",\n\"not A\", \":A and not A\", and \"not A and not not A''.

However, important\nproblems in areas ranging from ecology to medicine involve large collections of\nindividuals, and a further intellectual challenge is to model population-level\nbehavior based on a detailed individual-level model. Because of the large\nnumber of interacting individuals and because the individual-level model is\ncomplex, classical direct Monte Carlo simulations can be very slow, and often\nof little practical use. In this case, an equation-free approach may provide\neffective methods for the analysis and simulation of individual-based models.\nIn this paper we analyze equation-free coarse projective integration.
