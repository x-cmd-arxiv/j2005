We therefore used near infrared images\nobtained with ISAAC at the VLT and with SOFI at the NTT to determine the recent\nstar formation history in this merger. In combination with archival HST data,\nwe determined ages, extinction and other parameters for single star clusters,\nand properties of the cluster population as a whole. About 70% of the K_s-band\ndetected star clusters with masses >= 10^5 M_sun are younger than 10 Myrs\n(approximately an e-folding time for cluster ages), which we interpret as\nevidence for rapid dissolution but not free expansion. The total mass of K-band\nselected clusters is about 5-10x10^8 M_sun and represents about 3-6% of the\ntotal molecular gas. This takes into account only the detected clusters and in\nview of the rapid dissolution means that this is only a lower limit to the\ntotal mass of stars produced in clusters during the burst. Studies of cluster\nformation in other galaxies recently suggested short cluster dissolution\ntimescales, too, which means that star formation rates may have been severely\nunderestimated in the past. Extinction is strongly variable and very high in\nsome regions, but around A_V=1.3 mag on average. Even though most clusters are\ndetected at least in I-band, only the information about individual cluster ages\nand extinction allows to avoid uncertainties of orders of magnitude in star\nformation rate estimates determined from optical fluxes. From the distribution\nof individual cluster extinction vs. age, which is significantly higher for\nclusters below 8-9 Myr than for older clusters, we infer that this is the time\nby which a typical cluster blows free of its native dust cocoon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2005 16:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

However, halo triaxiality may act to bias\nthe profile constraints derived assuming a spherically symmetric mass\ndistribution, since lensing relates only to the projected mass distribution. A\ndegree of halo triaxiality is inherent to the CDM structure formation, arising\nfrom the collision-less nature of the dark matter.

Both Yukawa and gauge interactions are considered and the\none-loop results found can be used to study the ``running'' of the scalar field\nmass with respect to the momentum scale in 5D orbifolds. In particular this\nallows the study of the behaviour of the mass under UV scaling of the momentum.\nThe relation between supersymmetry breaking and the presence of higher\nderivative counterterms to the mass of the scalar field is investigated. This\nshows that, regardless of the breaking mechanism, (initial) supersymmetry\ncannot, in general, prevent the emergence of such operators. Some implications\nfor phenomenology of the higher derivative operators are also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2005 21:17:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2005 17:37:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2005 17:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}

In the general case, neither the average rate of growth nor the\nvariance or any finite number of moments of the initial distribution is\nsufficient to predict the overall population growth.

The uni-directional case is discussed in the framework of the RNA\nworld. Similar to earlier models of this type, where polymerization was assumed\nto proceed in a bi-directional fashion (presumed to be relevant to peptide\nnucleic acids), left-handed and right-handed monomers are produced via an\nautocatalysis from an achiral substrate. The details of the bifurcation from a\nracemic solution to a homochiral state of either handedness is shown to be\nremarkably independent of whether the polymerization in uni-directional or\nbi-directional. Slightly larger differences are seen when dissociation is\nallowed and the dissociation fragments are being recycled into the achiral\nsubstrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2005 06:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Two different situations have\nbeen studied. We first consider two non-interacting particles. The results show\nthat because of entanglement, the geometric phase is very different from that\nof the non-entangled case. When the initial state is a Werner state, the\ngeometric phase is, in general, zero and moreover the singularity of the\ngeometric phase may appear with a proper evolution time. We next study the\ngeometric phase when intra-couplings appear and choose Werner states as the\ninitial states to entail this discussion. The results show that unlike our\nfirst case, the absolute value of the GP is not zero, and attains its maximum\nwhen the rescaled coupling constant $J$ is less than 1.
