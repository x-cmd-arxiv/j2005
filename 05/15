These facts may\nimplicate a necessity to change the standard cosmological paradigm. Some\nfeatures of a new paradigm are discussed. In a frame of this model, every\nobserver has two different cosmological horizons. One of them is defined by\nmaximum existing temperatures of remote sources - by big enough distances, all\nof them will be masked with the CMB radiation. Another, and much smaller, one\ndepends on their maximum luminosity - the luminosity distance increases with a\nredshift much quickly than the geometrical one.\n  If the considered quantum mechanism of classical gravity is realized in the\nnature, then an existence of black holes contradicts to the equivalence\nprinciple. In this approach, the two fundamental constants - Hubble's and\nNewton's ones - should be connected between themselves. The theoretical value\nof the Hubble constant is computed. Also, every massive body would be\ndecelerated due to collisions with gravitons that may be connected with the\nPioneer 10 anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 May 2005 19:34:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2005 16:23:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2006 08:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

The method is simple,\nobjective, and makes few ad hoc assumptions. It is argued that this approach\nshould be used to provide a baseline prediction for certain space weather\npurposes, upon which other methods, incorporating additional information, can\nimprove. A practical implementation of the method for whole-Sun prediction of\nGeostationary Observational Environment Satellite (GOES) events is described in\ndetail, and is demonstrated for 4 November 2003, the day of the largest\nrecorded GOES flare. A test of the method is described based on the historical\nrecord of GOES events (1975-2003), and a detailed comparison is made with US\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predictions for\n1987-2003. Although the NOAA forecasts incorporate a variety of other\ninformation, the present method out-performs the NOAA method in predicting mean\nnumbers of event days, for both M-X and X events. Skill scores and other\nmeasures show that the present method is slightly less accurate at predicting\nM-X events than the NOAA method, but substantially more accurate at predicting\nX events, which are important contributors to space weather.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 May 2005 23:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

To further elucidate a description this magnetic ground\nstate, we have carried out a systematic study of single crystalline CeAgSb2 by\nmagnetic, electrical magneto-transport, and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) studies\nover a broad range of temperature and magnetic field. We have constructed the\nmagnetic phase diagram based solely on magnetoresistance data. Here, depending\non the orientation of the magnetic field H, either ferromagnetic or\nantiferromagnetic ordering occurs below TO. The resistivity of this compound\nbelow TO does not follow a simple Fermi liquid behavior, but requires an\nadditional contribution from conduction electron scattering from boson\nexcitations with an energy gap, D. At zero field the temperature dependent\nresistivity below TO is most consistent with antiferromagnetic order, based on\nthe transport theory which includes magnon scattering. Crystal field effect\ntheory applied to the susceptibility data yields splitting energies from the\nground state to the first and second excited states of 53 K and 137 K,\nrespectively. Although there is some uncertainty in the Kondo temperature\ndetermination, we estimate TK ~ 23 K from our analysis. In the Fermi surface\nstudies, the measurements show very small Fermi surface sections, not predicted\nby band structure calculations, and the SdH amplitudes are very sensitive to\nfield direction. Only by considering lens orbits between the main Fermi surface\ncylinders can the SdH results be reconciled with the Fermi surface topology\npredicted from band structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 May 2005 16:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
