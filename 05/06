Short-range forces\nare computed by direct summation of close pairs; particles are distributed\nusing a dynamic domain decomposition based on a space-filling Hilbert curve. A\nnearly-optimal method was devised to dynamically repartition the particle\ndistribution so as to maintain load balance even for extremely inhomogeneous\nmass distributions. Tests using $800^3$ simulations on a 40-processor beowulf\ncluster showed good load balance and scalability up to 80 processes.

Spectroscopic redshifts are determined for 44 sources, of which\nonly two are contaminating low mass stars. When allowance is made for\nincompleteness, the spectroscopic redshift distribution closely matches that\npredicted earlier on the basis of photometric data. Our spectra are of\nsufficient quality that we can address the important question of the nature and\nhomogeneity of the z>0.8 ERO population. A dominant old stellar population is\ninferred for 75% of our spectroscopic sample; a higher fraction than that seen\nin smaller, less-complete samples with broader photometric selection criteria\n(e.g. R-K). However, only 28% have spectra with no evidence of recent star\nformation activity, such as would be expected for a strictly passively-evolving\npopulation. More than ~30% of our absorption line spectra are of the `E+A' type\nwith prominent Balmer absorption consistent, on average, with mass growth of\n5-15% in the past Gyr. We use our spectroscopic redshifts to improve earlier\nestimates of the spatial clustering of this population as well as to understand\nthe significant field-to-field variation. Our spectroscopy enables us to\npinpoint a filamentary structure at z=1.22 in the Chandra Deep Field South.\nOverall, our study suggests that the bulk of the ERO population is an\nestablished population of clustered massive galaxies undergoing intermittent\nactivity consistent with continued growth over the redshift interval 0.8<z<1.6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2005 11:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The procedure concerns quantum generators of\nPoincare group, Hilbert and Fock space, anticommutations and velocity\nsuper-selection rule, propagator and Feynman rules, finite mass corrections,\ntrivialization of gluon couplings and renormalization of Wilson loop. The\nLorentz invariance and discrete symmetries in HQEFT are explicitly illustrated.\nSome new symmetries in the infinite mass limit are discussed. Weak transition\nmatrix elements and masses of hadrons in HQEFT are well defined to display a\nmanifest spin-flavor symmetry and $1/m_Q$ corrections. A simple trace\nformulation approach is explicitly demonstrated by using LSZ reduction formula\nin HQEFT, and shown to be very useful for parameterizing the transition form\nfactors via $1/m_Q$ expansion. As the heavy quark and antiquark fields in HQEFT\nare treated on the same footing in a fully symmetric way, the quark-antiquark\ncoupling terms naturally appear and play important roles for simplifying the\nstructure of transition matrix elements, and for understanding the concept of\n`dressed heavy quark' - hadron duality. In the case that the `longitudinal' and\n`transverse' residual momenta of heavy quark are at the same order of power\ncounting, HQEFT provides a consistent approach for systematically analyzing\nheavy quark expansion in terms of $1/m_Q$. Some interesting features in\napplications of HQEFT to heavy hadron systems are briefly outlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2005 09:17:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2006 04:28:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Oct 2006 08:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

As a consequence, the scheme is proved to be\nunconditionally stable and convergent for the Stokes problem, the steady and\nthe transient Navier-Stokes equations.

This protocol uses four\nstates (more precisely, two complementary bases) for the encoding of the\nclassical bit. Recently, it has been noticed that by using the same four\nstates, but a different encoding of information, one can define a new protocol\nwhich is more robust in practical implementations, specifically when attenuated\nlaser pulses are used instead of single-photon sources [V. Scarani et al.,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 92}, 057901 (2004); referred to as SARG04]. We present a\ndetailed study of SARG04 in two different regimes. In the first part, we\nconsider an implementation with a single-photon source: we derive bounds on the\nerror rate $Q$ for security against all possible attacks by the eavesdropper.\nThe lower and the upper bound obtained for SARG04 ($Q\\lesssim 10.95%$ and\n$Q\\gtrsim 14.9%$ respectively) are close to those obtained for BB84 ($Q\\lesssim\n12.4%$ and $Q\\gtrsim 14.6%$ respectively). In the second part, we consider the\nrealistic source consisting of an attenuated laser and improve on previous\nanalysis by allowing Alice to optimize the mean number of photons as a function\nof the distance. SARG04 is found to perform better than BB84, both in secret\nkey rate and in maximal achievable distance, for a wide class of Eve's attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2005 11:07:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2005 12:28:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

That same formalism\nhas important applications in the field of quantum error correcting codes,\nwhere mixed stabiliser states correspond to projectors on subspaces associated\nwith stabiliser codes. Here, we derive efficient reduction procedures to obtain\nvarious useful normal forms for stabiliser states. We explicitly prove that\nthese procedures will always converge to the correct result and that these\nprocedures are efficient in that they only require a polynomial number of\noperations on the generators of the stabilisers.\n  We obtain two single-party normal forms. The simplest, the row-reduced\nechelon form, is useful to calculate partial traces of stabiliser states. The\nsecond is the fully reduced form and allows for the efficient calculation of\nthe overlap between two stabiliser states, as well as of the Uhlmann fidelity\nbetween them, and their Bures distance.\n  We also find a reduction procedure of bipartite stabiliser states, where the\noperations involved are restricted to be local ones. Using this two-party\nnormal form, we prove that every bipartite mixed stabiliser state is locally\nequivalent to a direct product of a number of maximally entangled states and a\nseparable state. Using this normal form we can efficiently calculate every\nreasonable bipartite entanglement measure of mixed stabiliser states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2005 11:51:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2005 12:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Our protocol\ngives rise to the asymptotically optimal EPR pair distillation procedure for a\ngiven tripartite pure state, and we show that it actually yields EPR and GHZ\nstates; in fact, under a restricted class of protocols, which we call \"one-way\nbroadcasting\", the GHZ-rate is shown to be optimal.\n  This result implies a capacity theorem for quantum channels where the\nenvironment helps transmission by broadcasting the outcome of an optimally\nchosen measurement. We discuss generalisations to m parties, and show (for m=4)\nthat the maximal amount of entanglement that can be localised between two\nparties is given by the smallest entropy of a group of parties of which the one\nparty is a member, but not the other. This gives an explicit expression for the\nasymptotic localisable entanglement, and shows that any nontrivial ground state\nof a spin system can be used as a perfect quantum repeater if many copies are\navailable in parallel.\n  Finally, we provide evidence that any unital channel is asymptotically\nequivalent to a mixture of unitaries, and any general channel to a mixture of\npartial isometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2005 15:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
