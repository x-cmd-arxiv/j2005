Our model\nincludes metal-dependent radiative cooling and star formation in dense\ncollapsed gas clumps. Metals are returned into the diffuse interstellar medium\nby star particles using a local SPH smoothing kernel. A variety of chemical\nabundance patterns in enriched gas arise in our treatment owing to the\ndifferent yields and lifetimes of SNII and SNIa progenitor stars. In the case\nof SNII chemical production, we adopt metal-dependent yields. Because of the\nsensitive dependence of cooling rates on metallicity, enrichment of galactic\nhaloes with metals can in principle significantly alter subsequent gas infall\nand the build up of the stellar components. Indeed, in simulations of isolated\ngalaxies we find that a consistent treatment of metal-dependent cooling\nproduces 25% more stars outside the central region than simulations with a\nprimordial cooling function. In the highly-enriched central regions, the\nevolution of baryons is however not affected by metal cooling, because here the\ngas is always dense enough to cool. A similar situation is found in\ncosmological simulations because we include no strong feedback processes which\ncould spread metals over large distances and mix them into unenriched diffuse\ngas. We demonstrate this explicitly with test simulations which adopt\nsuper-solar cooling functions leading to large changes both in the stellar mass\nand in the metal distributions. We also find that the impact of metallicity on\nthe star formation histories of galaxies may depend on their particular\nevolutionary history.

Of these, 80% lie in clusters, representative of star\nformation across the Galaxy. Two of the groups of cores are associated with the\nyoung stellar clusters IC348 and NGC1333, and are consistent with a steady or\nreduced star formation rate in the last 0.5 Myr, but not an increasing one. In\nPerseus, 40--60% of cores are in small clusters (< 50 msun) and isolated\nobjects, much more than the 10% suggested from infrared studies. Complementing\nthe dust continuum, we present a C^18O map of the whole cloud at 1' resolution.\nThe gas and dust show filamentary structure of the dense gas on large and small\nscales, with the high column density filaments breaking up into clusters of\ncores. The filament mass per unit length is 5--11 msun per 0.1 pc. Given these\nfilament masses, there is no requirement for substantial large scale flows\nalong or onto the filaments in order to gather sufficient material for star\nformation. We find that the probability of finding a submillimetre core is a\nstrongly increasing function of column density, as measured by C^18O integrated\nintensity, prob(core) proportional to I^3.0. This power law relation holds down\nto low column density, suggesting that there is no A_v threshold for star\nformation in Perseus, unless all the low-A_v submm cores can be demonstrated to\nbe older protostars which have begun to lose their natal molecular cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2005 15:12:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2005 12:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We have carried out a\nthorough investigation of the micro- and macro-mechanical factors affecting\nthese variables, by means of Molecular Dynamics simulations of a polydisperse\ndisk packing, as a simple model system for granular material. Biaxial test\nboundary conditions with a periodically cycling load were implemented. The\neffect on the plastic response of the confining pressure, the deviatoric stress\nand the number of cycles has been investigated. The stiffness of the contacts\nand friction has been shown to play an important role in the overall response\nof the system. Specially elucidating is the influence of the particular\nhysteretical behavior in the stress-strain space on the accumulation of\npermanent strain and the energy dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2005 09:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

The balanced exponents\nare generalizations of an exact solution of the scale-invariant kinetic\nequation, the Pelinovsky--Raevsky spectrum. A balance between oppositely signed\ndivergences states that infinity minus infinity may be approximately equal to\nzero. A small but finite Coriolis parameter representing the effects of\nrotation is introduced into the kinetic equation to determine solutions over\nthe divergent part of the domain using rigorous asymptotic arguments. This\ngives rise to the induced diffusion regime. The derivation of the kinetic\nequation is based on an assumption of weak nonlinearity. Dominance of the\nnonlocal interactions puts the self-consistency of the kinetic equation at\nrisk. Yet these weakly nonlinear stationary states are consistent with much of\nthe observational evidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2005 17:47:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2008 14:41:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2010 16:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-08"}

We discuss both, the novel deterministic model of\nthe hydrogen atom, in which the existence of hydrinos was predicted, and\nstandard quantum mechanics. Severe inconsistencies in the deterministic model\nare pointed out and the incompatibility of hydrino states with quantum\nmechanics is reviewed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2005 10:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
