From a\ncomparison between the observed and predicted age distributions in the age\nrange between 10 Myr to 3 Gyr we find the following results: (1) The disruption\ntime of a 10^4 M_sun cluster in the solar neighbourhood is about 1.3+/-0.5 Gyr.\nThis is a factor 5 shorter than derived from N-body simulations of clusters in\nthe tidal field of the galaxy. (2) The present starformation rate in bound\nclusters within 600 pc from the Sun is 5.9+/-0.8 * 10^2 M_sun / Myr, which\ncorresponds to a surface star formation rate in bound clusters of 5.2+/-0.7\n10^(-10) M_sun/yr/pc^2. (3) The age distribution of open clusters shows a bump\nbetween 0.26 and 0.6 Gyr when the cluster formation rate was 2.5 times higher\nthan before and after. (4) The present star formation rate in bound clusters is\nhalf as small as that derived from the study of embedded clusters. The\ndifference suggests that half of the clusters in the solar neighbourhood become\nunbound within 10 Myr. (5) The most massive clusters within 600 pc had an\ninitial mass of 3*10^4 M_sun. This is in agreement with the statistically\nexpected value based on a cluster initial mass function with a slope of -2,\neven if the physical upper mass limit is as high as 10^6 M_sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2005 15:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

A choice of\nHilbert subspaces is described which allows an exact solution of the stationary\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation without imposing periodic boundary conditions and\nwithout neglecting end effects, fully including the dipole-dipole\nnearest-neighbor interaction between the atoms. The treatment is valid for an\narbitrary coherent excitation in the atomic system, any number of atoms, any\nsize of the chain relative to the resonant wavelength and arbitrary initial\nconditions of the atomic system. The procedure we develop is general enough to\nbe adopted for the study of excitation in an arbitrary array of atoms including\nspin chains and one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2005 04:45:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2005 05:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nfull inseparability in the ideal case is shown, whereas thresholds for\nseparability are given for the tripartite case in the presence of noise. We\nthen consider coherent states of ${\\rm SU}(m,1)$ as support for a telecloning\nprotocol, providing the first example of a completely asymmetric $1 \\to m$\ntelecloning. We derive explicitly the optimal relation among the different\nfidelities of the clones. The effect of noise in the various stages of the\nprotocol is taken into account, thus permitting its adaptive modifications to\nthe noisy environment. In the optimized scheme the clones' fidelity remains\nmaximal even in the presence of losses (in the absence of thermal noise), for\npropagation times that diverge as the number of modes increases, indicating\nthat telecloning is a more effective way to distribute quantum information then\ndirect transmission followed by local cloning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2005 09:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2005 16:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
