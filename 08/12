The spectral\nsignature of this excess near-infrared background light (NIRBL) component is\nalmost identical to that of reflected sunlight from the interplanetary dust\ncloud, and could therefore be the result of the incomplete subtraction of this\nforeground emission component from the diffuse sky maps. Alternatively, this\nemission component could be extragalactic. Its spectral signature is consistent\nwith that of redshifted continuum and recombination line emission from HII\nregions formed by the first generation of very massive stars. In this paper we\nanalyze the implications of this spectral component for the formation rate of\nthese Population III stars, the redshift interval during which they formed, the\nreionization of the universe and evolution of collapsed halo masses. We find\nthat to reproduce the intensity and spectral shape of the NIRBL requires a peak\nstar formation rate that is higher by about a factor of 4 to 10 compared to\nthose derived from hierarchical models. Furthermore, an extragalactic origin\nfor the NIRBL leads to physically unrealistic absorption-corrected spectra of\ndistant TeV blazars. All these results suggest that Pop III stars contribute\nonly a fraction of the NIRBL intensity with zodiacal light, star forming\ngalaxies, and/or non-nuclear sources giving rise to the remaining fraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2005 18:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Perfect reconstruction is seldom possible and\nperformance is measured under a given fidelity criterion. In a recent work, the\nauthors addressed the problem of denoising unknown discrete signals corrupted\nby a discrete memoryless channel when the channel, rather than being completely\nknown, is only known to lie in some uncertainty set of possible channels. A\nsequence of denoisers was derived for this case and shown to be asymptotically\noptimal with respect to a worst-case criterion argued most relevant to this\nsetting. In the present work we address the implementation and complexity of\nthis denoiser for channels parametrized by a scalar, establishing its\npracticality. We show that for symmetric channels, the problem can be mapped\ninto a convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently. We also\npresent empirical results suggesting the potential of these schemes to do well\nin practice. A key component of our schemes is an estimator of the subset of\nchannels in the uncertainty set that are feasible in the sense of being able to\ngive rise to the noise-corrupted signal statistics for some channel input\ndistribution. We establish the efficiency of this estimator, both\nalgorithmically and experimentally. We also present a modification of the\nrecently developed discrete universal denoiser (DUDE) that assumes a channel\nbased on the said estimator, and show that, in practice, the resulting scheme\nperforms well. For concreteness, we focus on the binary alphabet case and\nbinary symmetric channels, but also discuss the extensions of the algorithms to\ngeneral finite alphabets and to general channels parameterized by a scalar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2005 22:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

These\nmolecules exhibit particularly severe degrees of inner polarization, and as\nsuch obtaining a basis-set limit SCF component to the total atomization energy\nbecomes a challenge. (Adding high-exponent $d$ functions to a standard $spd$\nbasis set has an effect on the order of 100 kcal/mol for Cl$_2$O$_7$.) Wilson's\naug-cc-pV(n+d)Z basis sets represent a dramatic improvement over the standard\naug-cc-pVnZ basis sets, while the aug-cc-pVnZ+2d1f sequence converges still\nmore rapidly. Jensen's polarization consistent basis sets still require\nadditional high-exponent $d$ functions: for smooth convergence we suggest the\n\\{aug-pc1+3d,aug-pc2+2d,aug-pc3+d,aug-pc4\\} sequence. The role of the tight $d$\nfunctions is shown to be an improved description of the Cl (3d) Rydberg\norbital, enhancing its ability to receive back-bonding from the oxygen lone\npairs. In problematic cases like this (or indeed in general), a single\nSCF/aug-cc-pV6Z+2d1f calculation may be preferable over empirically motivated\nextrapolations. Our best estimate heats of formation are $\\Delta\nH^\\circ_{f,298}[$HClO$_4$(g)$]=-0.6\\pm$1 kcal/mol and $\\Delta\nH^\\circ_{f,298}[$Cl$_2$O$_7$(g)$]=65.9\\pm$2 kcal/mol, the largest source of\nuncertainty being our inability to account for post-CCSD(T) correlation\neffects.
