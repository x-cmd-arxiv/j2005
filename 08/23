We investigate the sensitivity of these\nlong X-ray bursts to the thermal profile of the neutron star crust and core. We\nfirst compare cooling models of superburst lightcurves with observations, and\nderive constraints on the ignition mass and energy release, and then calculate\nignition models for superbursts and pure helium bursts, and compare to\nobservations. The superburst lightcurves and ignition models imply that the\ncarbon mass fraction is approximately 20% or greater in the fuel layer,\nconstraining models of carbon production. However, the most important result is\nthat when Cooper pairing neutrino emission is included in the crust, the\ntemperature is too low to support unstable carbon ignition at the observed\ncolumn depths. Some additional heating mechanism is required in the\naccumulating fuel layer to explain the observed properties of superbursts. If\nCooper pair emission is less efficient than currently thought, the observed\nignition depths for superbursts imply that the crust is a poor conductor, and\nthe core neutrino emission is not more efficient than modified URCA. The\nobserved properties of helium bursts support these conclusions, requiring\ninefficient crust conductivity and core neutrino emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2005 16:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The observed\nstructural parameters agree well with the properties of thick and thin disks\nderived from star counts in the Milky Way and from resolved stellar populations\nin nearby galaxies.

We calculate the orbital evolution of\n`planetesimals' and protoplanets with masses in the range 0 < m_p < 30 M_Earth.\nPlanetesimals and protoplanets undergo stochastic migration due to interaction\nwith turbulent density fluctuations. Over run times of ~ 150 planet orbits,\nstochastic migration dominates over type I migration for many models. Fourier\nanalysis of the torques experienced by planets indicates that the torque\nfluctuations contain components with significant power whose time scales of\nvariation are similar to the simulation run times. These low frequency\nfluctuations partly explain the dominance of stochastic torques, and may\nprovide a powerful means of counteracting the type I migration of some planets\nin turbulent disks. Turbulence is a source of eccentricity driving.\nPlanetesimals attained eccentricities in the range 0.02 < e < 0.14, m_p=1\nM_Earth planets attained eccentricities 0.02 < e < 0.08, and m_p=10 M_Earth\nprotoplanets reached 0.02 < e < 0.03. This is in basic agreement with a model\nin which turbulence drives e-growth, and interaction with disk material at\ncoorbital Lindblad resonances causes e-damping.

The growth of\nplanetary cores may be enhanced by preventing isolation. Eccentricity\nexcitation by turbulence, however, may reduce growth rates of planetary cores\nduring the runaway and oligarchic growth stages, and cause collisions between\nplanetesimals to become destructive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2005 13:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This phenomenon is known as enhanced\nbackscattering (EBS). According to diffusion theory, the angular width of an\nEBS cone is proportional to the ratio of the wavelength of light $\\lambda$ to\nthe transport mean free path length ls* of a random medium. In biological\nmedia, large ls* ~ 0.5-2 mm >> $\\lambda$ results in an extremely small (~0.001\n$^\\degree$) angular width of the EBS cone making the experimental observation\nof such narrow peaks difficult. Recently, the feasibility of observing EBS\nunder low spatial coherence illumination (spatial coherence length Lsc<<ls*)\nwas demonstrated. Low spatial coherence behaves as a spatial filter rejecting\nlonger path-lengths and, thus, resulting in more than 100 times increase in the\nangular width of low coherence EBS (LEBS) cones. However, conventional\ndiffusion approximation-based model of EBS has not been able to explain such\ndramatic increase in LEBS width.

In contrast, the transverse electric field is shown\nto be created about 1/4 wavelength outside the source and launches superluminal\nfields both towards and away from the source which reduce to the speed of light\nas the field propagates about one wavelength from the source. An experiment\nusing simple dipole antennas is shown to verify the predicted superluminal\ntransverse electric field behavior.

We show this via the no-switching protocol which results in\nhigher information rates and a simpler experimental setup. We propose an\noptimal eavesdropping attack against this protocol, for individual Gaussian\nattacks, and we investigate and compare the no-switching protocol applied to\nthe original BB84 scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2005 10:35:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
