The CO lines have a double peak profile in all\ntransitions. From a Gaussian decomposition of the spectra we show that the CO\nline ratios, and therefore the underlying physical conditions of the gas, are\nsimilar for the blue and the redshifted component. The CO line Spectral Energy\nDistribution (SED; i.e. flux density vs. rotational quantum number) turns over\nalready at the CO(5--4) transition which shows that the molecular gas is less\nexcited than in nearby starburst galaxies and high--z QSOs. This difference\nmainly arises from a lower average H2 density, which indicates that the gas is\nless centrally concentrated than in nuclear starburst regions in local\ngalaxies. We suggest that the bulk of the molecular gas in SMM J16359+6612 may\narise from an overlap region of two merging galaxies. The low gas density and\nclear velocity separation may reflect an evolutionary stage of the merger event\nthat is in between those seen in the Antennae and in the more evolved\nultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) like e.g. Mrk231.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2005 16:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The spectral analysis confirms that the\npresence of a blackbody component in addition to the power-law is required.\nSince this additional component is consistent with being constant with respect\nto the earlier observations, we explore the possibility of describing the\nlong-term spectral evolution as only due to the power-law variations. In this\ncase, the slope of the power-law does not significantly change and the spectral\nsoftening following the giant flare is caused by the increase of the relative\ncontribution of the blackbody over the power-law component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2005 14:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The computational\ndomain for the numerical simulations is cubic, and periodic boundary conditions\nare imposed. The goal is the development of a suitable flame speed model for\nthe small-scale dynamics of turbulent deflagration in thermonuclear supernovae.\nBecause the burning process in a supernova explosion is transient and spatially\ninhomogeneous, the localised determination of subgrid scale closure parameters\nis essential.

The average surface brightness of the of a field is shown to\ndirectly influence the accuracy of the SFM. This restricts meaningful\nmeasurements to the disks of spiral galaxies.

INEX 2003 content-and-structure topics\ncan be classified in two categories: the first retrieving full articles as\nfinal answers, and the second retrieving more specific elements within articles\nas final answers. We show that for both topic categories our initial hybrid\nsystem improves the retrieval effectiveness of a native XML database. For\nranking the final answer elements, we propose and evaluate a novel retrieval\nmodel that utilises the structural relationships between the answer elements of\na native XML database and retrieves Coherent Retrieval Elements.

We show that traditional\ncriteria on the stability of semiclassical gravity are incomplete because these\ncriteria based on the linearized semiclassical Einstein equation can only\nprovide information on the expectation value and the intrinsic fluctuations of\nthe metric perturbations. By contrast, the framework of stochastic\nsemiclassical gravity provides a more complete and accurate criterion because\nit contains information on the induced fluctuations as well. The\nEinstein-Langevin equation therein contains a stochastic source characterized\nby the noise kernel (the symmetrized two-point quantum correlation function of\nthe stress tensor operator) and yields stochastic correlation functions for the\nmetric perturbations which agree, to leading order in the large N limit, with\nthe quantum correlation functions of the theory of gravity interacting with N\nmatter fields. These points are illustrated with the example of Minkowski\nspacetime as a solution to the semiclassical Einstein equation, which is found\nto be stable under both intrinsic and induced fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2005 16:46:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This work is the first variational study of {\\em\nmultibody} bound states. We will consider: (i) ``polymer chains'' of the type\n$\\bar q g g ..g q$; (ii) baryons $(qqq)$; (iii) closed (3-)chains of gluons\n$(ggg)$. We found that chains (i) form in exactly the same $T$ range as binary\nstates, with the same binding {\\em per bond}. The binding and $T$-range for\ndiquarks, baryons and closed 3-chains are also established. We point out that\nthe presence of chains, or possibly even a chain network, may drastically\nchange the transport properties of matter, such as charm diffusion or jet\nenergy loss. We further suggest that it seems to exist only for $T=(1-1.5)T_c$\nand thus there may be a ``latent period'' for charm/jet quenching in RHIC\ncollisions, while matter cools down to such $T$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2005 14:40:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2005 03:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We then recast the inverse-scattering problem\nas a Riemann-Hilbert problem and provide a rigorous asymptotic analysis of this\nproblem in the large-N limit. For those $(x,t)$ where results have been\nobtained by other authors, we improve the error estimates from $O(N^{-1/3})$ to\n$O(N^{-1})$.
