The coefficients of these linear forms, viewed as 3D vectors, are\ncalled \\emph{multipole} vectors of $P$. In this paper we consider similar\nmultipole representations of polynomial and analytic functions on other\nquadratic surfaces $Q(x, y, z) = c$, real and complex. Over the complex\nnumbers, the above representation is not unique, although the ambiguity is\nessentially finite. We investigate the combinatorics that depicts this\nambiguity. We link these results with some classical theorems of harmonic\nanalysis, theorems that describe decompositions of functions into sums of\nspherical harmonics. We extend these classical theorems (which rely on our\nunderstanding of the Laplace operator $\\Delta_{S^2}$) to more general\ndifferential operators $\\Delta_Q$ that are constructed with the help of the\nquadratic form $Q(x, y, z)$. Then we introduce modular spaces of multipoles. We\nstudy their intricate geometry and topology using methods of algebraic geometry\nand singularity theory. The multipole spaces are ramified over vector or\nprojective spaces, and the compliments to the ramification sets give rise to a\nrich family of $K(\\pi, 1)$-spaces, where $\\pi$ runs over a variety of modified\nbraid groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2005 20:32:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
