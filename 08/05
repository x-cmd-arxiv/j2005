The nature of the dust-forming environment is influenced\nby the evolution of the stars, in terms of both chemistry and density, leading\nto an evolution in the nature of the dust that is produced. Carbon-rich AGB\nstars are known to produce silicon carbide (SiC). Furthermore, observations of\nthe ~11um SiC feature show that the spectral features change in a sequence that\ncorrelates with stellar evolution. We present new infrared spectra of amorphous\nSiC and show that the ~9um feature seen in both emission and absorption, and\ncorrelated with trends in the ~11um feature, may be due to either amorphous SiC\nor to nano-crystalline diamond with a high proportion of Si substituting for C.\nFurthermore, we identify SiC absorption in three ISO spectra of extreme carbon\nstars, in addition to the four presented by Speck et al. (1997). An accurate\ndescription of the sequence in the IR spectra of carbon stars requires\naccounting for both SiC emission and absorption features. This level of detail\nis needed to infer the role of dust in evolution of carbon stars. Previous\nattempts to find a sequence in the infrared spectra of carbon stars considered\nSiC emission features, while neglecting SiC absorption features, leading to an\ninterpretation of the sequence inadequately describes the role of dust. We show\nthat the evolutionary sequence in carbon star spectra is consistent with a\ngrain size evolution, such that dust grains get progressively smaller as the\nstar evolves. The evolution of the grain sizes provides a natural explanation\nfor the shift of the ~11um SiC feature in emission and in absorption.

The definition of a new methane filter\nphotometric system is described. A recipe is provided for the differential\ncalibration of methane imaging data using existing 2MASS photometry. We show\nthat these filters are effective in discriminating T dwarfs from other types of\nstars, and demonstrate this with Anglo-Australian Telescope observations using\nthe IRIS2 imager. Methane imaging data and proper motions are presented for ten\nT dwarfs identified as part of the 2MASS \"Wide Field T Dwarf Search\" -- seven\nof them initially identified as T dwarfs using methane imaging.\n  We also present near-infrared moderate resolution spectra for five T dwarfs,\nnewly discovered by this technique. Spectral types obtained from these spectra\nare compared to those derived from both our methane filter observations, and\nspectral types derived by other observers. Finally, we suggest a range of\nfuture programs to which these filters are clearly well suited: the winnowing\nof T dwarf and Y dwarf candidate objects coming from the next generation of\nnear-infrared sky surveys; the robust detection of candidate planetary-mass\nbrown dwarfs in clusters; the detection of T dwarf companions to known L and T\ndwarfs via deep methane imaging; and the search for rotationally-modulated\ntime-variable surface features on cool brown dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2005 08:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

This paper presents the most\ncomprehensive radio continuum investigation of the region, relying on a\n63-pointing mosaic obtained with the Very Large Array yielding an areal\ncoverage of nearly 7 square degrees. The mosaic provides a typical sensitivity\nof about 80 uJy at a resolution of 16\", enabling detection of galaxies with\nstar formation rates as low as 1 solar mass per year. The radio data are\ncomplemented by optical imaging in B and R, producing a catalog of 210\nradio-detected galaxies with m_R <= 17.36 (M_R <= -19). At least 104 of these\nradio-detected galaxies are members of the supercluster on the basis of public\nvelocity measurements. Across the entire core of the supercluster, there\nappears to be a significant deficit of radio galaxies at intermediate optical\nmagnitudes (M_R between -21 and -22). This deficit is offset somewhat by an\nincrease in the frequency with which brighter galaxies (M_R less than -22) host\nradio sources. More dramatic is the highly significant increase in the\nprobability for fainter galaxies (M_R between -20 and -21) in the vicinity of\nA3562 and SC1329-313 to be associated with radio emission. The radio and\noptical data for these sources strongly suggest that these active galaxies are\npowered by star formation. In conjunction with recent X-ray analysis, this is\ninterpreted as young starbursts related to the recent merger of SC1329-313 with\nA3562 and the rest of the supercluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2005 14:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
