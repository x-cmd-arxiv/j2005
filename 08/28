The\nconstituent gluon models have also been assuming the Casimir scaling. Inspired\nin type-II superconductors, we explore a new scenario for the gluon-gluon\ninteraction where the adjoint string is replaced by a pair of fundamental\nstrings, resulting in a factor of 2, smaller than 9/4. To test our proposal we\nconstruct a simple constituent gluon model, extrapolated from the funnel\npotential for quarkonium, and apply it to compute the wave-function of\nglueballs and of hybrid gluelumps. From the decay widths of quarkonium, we also\nextrapolate the decay widths of the glueballs and hybrid gluelumps. Our\npredictions apply to charmonia, lightonia, glueballs and hybrid gluelumps with\nlarge angular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2005 10:39:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2006 23:50:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the second part I discuss a\nparticular case of SU(3) theories containing different limits of symmetry\nbreaking. It turns out that the multimonopole configurations are natural in a\nmodel with the gauge group of higher rank. Here I discuss fundamental and\ncomposite monopoles and consider the limiting situation of the massless states.\nIn the last part I briefly discuss construction of the $N = 2$ SU(2)\nsupersymmetric monopoles and some of the basic properties which are connected\nwith the field theoretical aspects of these classical solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2005 16:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
