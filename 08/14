Our observations provide a detailed picture of the supernova\nremnant in the emission lines of [O III] 5007, Halpha and [N II] 6548. The [O\nIII] Fabry-Perot scans reveal a bright crescent-shaped spur of previously known\nhigh-velocity (V_radial ~ 1500 km/s) O-rich ejecta located on the eastern side\nof the remnant. The spur consists of a semi-coherent structure of mostly\nredshifted material, along with several clumps that have apparently broken out\nof the more orderly shell-like expansion. The high velocity (>= 600 km/s)\ncomponent of the spur also displays a scalloped morphology characteristic of\nRayleigh-Taylor instabilities. We also find a large number of fast-moving knots\n(FMKs) of O-rich ejecta undetected in prior photographic plate images and\nsimilar to features seen in Cas A. The position-velocity distribution of the\nFMKs can be kinematically described as a shell 3.4' in radius expanding at a\nvelocity of 1700 km/s.

The bunches do not have to be at the same RF phase\nduring each recirculation turn. This is important for the description of energy\nrecovery linacs (ERLs) where beam currents become very large and coupled optics\nare used on purpose to increase the threshold current. A remarkable agreement\nwith tracking data is demonstrated. The general formulas are then analyzed for\nseveral analytically solvable cases, which show: (a) Why different higher order\nmodes (HOM) in one cavity can couple and cannot be considered individually,\neven when their frequencies are separated by much more than the resonance\nwidths of the HOMs. For the Cornell ERL as an example, it is noted that optimum\nadvantage of coupled optics is taken when the cavities are designed with an\n$x$-$y$ HOM frequency splitting of above 50MHz. The threshold current is then\nfar above the design current of this accelerator. (b) How the $x$-$y$ coupling\nin the particle optics determines when modes can be considered separately. (c)\nThat the increase of the threshold current obtainable by coupled optics and\npolarized modes diminishes roughly with the square root of the HOMs' quality\nfactors. Therefore the largest advantages are achieved with cavities that are\nnot specifically designed to minimize these quality factors, e.g. by means of\nHOM absorbers.

We develop a simplified model for the evolutionary dynamics of\nthis process, allowing us to solve for the steady-state using standard\napproaches from quasispecies theory. We find that our model exhibits two\ndistinct regimes of behavior: At low concentrations of limiting resource, the\ntwo-cell strategy outcompetes the single-cell survival strategy, while at high\nconcentrations of limiting resource, the single-cell survival strategy\ndominates. Associated with the two solution regimes of our model is a\nlocalization to delocalization transition over the portion of the genome coding\nfor the multicell strategy, analogous to the error catastrophe in standard\nquasispecies models. The existence of such a transition indicates that\nmulticellularity can emerge because natural selection does not act on specific\ncells, but rather on replicative strategies. Within this framework, individual\ncells become the means by which replicative strategies are propagated. Such a\nframework is therefore consistent with the concept that natural selection does\nnot act on individuals, but rather on populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2005 17:28:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Via an appropriate extension\nof the root system, new planes of reflection are introduced which determine\nlocal axes of rotational symmetry. An easy-to-implement formalism is derived\nthat allows to compute the surface structure of any three-dimensional\nicosahedral particle with local symmetries. It can be used also for particles\nwith overall octahedral and tetrahedral symmetry in conjunction with the root\nsystems of the corresponding reflection groups.\n  Applications to viruses are discussed explicitly. It is shown that the\nconcept of quasi-equivalence in Caspar-Klug Theory corresponds to the special\ncase of local six-fold symmetry axes contained in the theory developed here,\nand the corresponding geometries can hence be obtained with this formalism\nbased on the root system of H_3.\n  Moreover, as a by-product, the theory answers the long-standing open question\nwhy only certain types of capsomeres, i.e. clusters of protein subunits, are\nobserved in the surface structures of viruses. Since the types of the\ncapsomeres are determined by the orders of the local symmetry axes on which\nthey are located, the possible types of capsomeres are restricted by the\nspectrum of local symmetry axes allowed by the theory.
