In this paper, we systematically analyze the\npossible physical processes that shape the properties of the early X-ray\nafterglow lightcurves, and use the data to constrain various models. We suggest\nthat the steep decay component is consistent with the tail emission of the\nprompt gamma-ray bursts and/or of the X-ray flares. This provides clear\nevidence that the prompt emission and afterglow emission are two distinct\ncomponents, supporting the internal origin of the GRB prompt emission. The\nshallow decay segment observed in a group of GRBs suggests that the forward\nshock keeps being refreshed for some time. This might be caused either by a\nlong-lived central engine, or by a power law distribution of the shell Lorentz\nfactors, or else by the deceleration of a Poynting flux dominated flow. X-ray\nflares suggest that the GRB central engine is still active after the prompt\ngamma-ray emission is over, but with a reduced activity at later times. In some\ncases, the central engine activity even extends days after the burst trigger.\nAnalyses of early X-ray afterglow data reveal that GRBs are indeed highly\nrelativistic events. Early afterglow data of many bursts, starting from the\nbeginning of the XRT observations, are consistent with the afterglow emission\nfrom an interstellar medium (ISM) environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2005 17:52:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2005 05:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These results serve for\nthe derivation of an upper bound on the achievable rates of ensembles of LDPC\ncodes under optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding when their transmission\ntakes place over parallel MBIOS channels.

One of the main advantages of this new\nimplementation is that it naturally incorporates a loss detection mechanism\nthat makes the probability of a gate introducing a non-detected error, when\nnon-ideal detectors are considered, dependent only on the detector dark-count\nrate and independent of its efficiency. Since very low dark-count rate\ndetectors are currently available, a high-fidelity gate (probability of error\nof order $10^{-6}$ conditional on the gate being successful) can be implemented\nusing polarization encoding. The detector efficiency determines the overall\nsuccess probability of the gate but does not affect its fidelity. This can be\napplied to the efficient construction of optical cluster states with very high\nfidelity for quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2005 22:25:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2005 17:54:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
