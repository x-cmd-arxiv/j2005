Dynamical interactions involving BH binaries are computed\nexactly and are generated according to a Monte Carlo prescription. Recoil and\nejections lead to complete evaporation of the BH core on a timescale ~10^9 yr\nfor typical globular cluster parameters. Orbital decay driven by gravitational\nradiation can make binaries merge and, in some cases, successive mergers can\nlead to significant BH growth. Our highly simplified treatment of the cluster\ndynamics allows us to study a large number of models and to compute statistical\ndistributions of outcomes, such as the probability of massive BH growth and\nretention in a cluster. We find that, in most models, there is a significant\nprobability (~20-80%) of BH growth with final masses > 100 M_{\\sun}. In one\ncase, a final BH formed with mass ~ 620 M_{\\sun}. However, if the typical\nmerger recoil speed (due to asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation)\nsignificantly exceeds the cluster escape speed, no growth ever occurs.\nIndependent of the recoil speed, we find that BH-BH mergers enhanced by\ndynamical interactions in cluster cores present an important source of\ngravitational waves for ground--based laser interferometers. Under optimistic\nconditions, the total rate of detections by Advanced LIGO, could be as high as\na few tens of events per year from inspiraling BHs from clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2005 18:44:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2005 15:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

As such they\nshould be strong sources of gravitational waves and possible ancestors of the\naccreting AM CVn stars. Monitoring at X-ray and optical wavelengths has\nestablished that the period of each star is decreasing, at rates compatible\nwith that expected from gravitational radiation. This has been taken to support\nthe ``unipolar inductor'' model in which the white dwarfs are detached and the\nX-rays produced by the dissipation of magnetically-induced electric currents.\nIn this paper we show that this interpretation is incorrect because it ignores\nassociated torques which transfer angular momentum between the spin of the\nmagnetic white dwarf and the orbit. We show that this torque is 10^5 times\nlarger than the GR term in the case of V407 Vul, and 10 times larger for\nRXJ0806+1527. For V407 Vul, the unipolar inductor model can only survive if the\nwhite dwarf spins 100 times faster than the orbit. Since this could only come\nabout through accretion, the validity of the unipolar inductor appears\nquestionable for this star. We also consider whether accretion models can fit\nthe observed spin-up, concluding that they can, provided that a mechanism\nexists for driving the mass transfer rate away from its equilibrium value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2005 16:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These equations describe the time evolution of\nthe spin variables of the QD explicitly in terms of the response and\ncorrelation functions of the free reservoir variables. This scheme not only\nprovides analytical expressions for the relaxation and decoherence of the\nlocalized spin induced by cotunneling, but it also facilitates evaluations of\nthe nonequilibrium magnetization, the charge current, and the spin current at\narbitrary bias-voltage, magnetic field, and temperature. We find that all\ncotunneling events produce decoherence, but relaxation stems only from {\\em\ninelastic} spin-flip cotunneling processes. Moreover, our specific calculations\nshow that cotunneling processes involving electron transfer (both spin-flip and\nnon-spin-flip) contribute to charge current, while spin-flip cotunneling\nprocesses are required to produce a net spin current in the asymmetric coupling\ncase.

We\nconsider the first passage times for the case of classical diffusion,\ncharacterized by a mean-square displacement of the form $< (\\Delta x)^2> \\sim\nt$, and for the case of anomalous diffusion or subdiffusion, characterized by a\nmean-square displacement of the form $< (\\Delta x)^2> \\sim t^{\\gamma}$ with\n$0<\\gamma<1$.

I show how such an apparatus generalizes the original\nprojection synthesis technique, introduced as an in principle technique to\nmeasure the canonical phase distribution. Just as for the original projection\nsynthesis, it is found that such a generalised device can synthesize any\ngeneral projection onto a state in a finite dimensional Hilbert space. One of\nthe important findings of this thesis is that, unlike the original projection\nsynthesis technique, the general apparatus described here only requires a\nclassical, that is a coherent, reference field at the input of the device. Such\nan apparatus lends itself much more readily to practical implementation and\nwould find applications in measurement and predictive state engineering.\n  If we relax the above condition to allow for just a single non-classical\nreference field, we show that the apparatus is capable of producing a\nsingle-shot measure of canonical phase. That is, the apparatus can project onto\nany one of an arbitrarily large subset of phase eigenstates, with a probability\nproportional to the overlap of the phase state and the input field. Unlike the\noriginal projection synthesis proposal, this proposal requires a binomial\nreference state as opposed to a reciprocal binomial state. We find that such a\nreference state can be obtained, to an excellent approximation, from a suitably\nsqueezed state.\n  The analysis of these measurement apparatuses is performed in the less usual,\nbut completely rigorous, retrodictive formalism of quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2005 09:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
