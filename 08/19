From a subsample of 56 galaxies, for which metallicity of the\ninterstellar medium is also measured, we identified a strong correlation\nbetween mass and metallicity, for the first time in the distant Universe. This\nwas possible because of the larger base line spanned by the sample in terms of\nmetallicity (a factor of 7) and mass (a factor of 400) than in previous works.\nThis correlation is much stronger and tighter than the luminosity-metallicity,\nconfirming that stellar mass is a more meaningful physical parameter than\nluminosity. We find clear evidence for temporal evolution in the M-Z relation\nin the sense that at a given mass, a galaxy at z=0.7 tends to have lower\nmetallicity than a local galaxy of similar mass. We use the z=0.1 SDSS M-Z\nrelation, and a small sample of z=2.3 Lyman break galaxies with known mass and\nmetallicity, to propose an empirical redshift-dependent M-Z relation, according\nto which the stellar mass and metallicity in small galaxies evolve for a longer\ntime than in massive galaxies. This relation predicts that the generally metal\npoor damped Lyman-alpha galaxies have stellar masses of the order of 10^8.8\nM_sun (with a dispersion of 0.7 dex) all the way from z=0.2 to z=4. The\nobserved redshift evolution of the M-Z relation can be reproduced remarkably\nwell by a simple closed-box model where the key assumption is an e-folding time\nfor star formation which is higher or, in other words, a period of star\nformation that lasts longer in less massive galaxies than in more massive\ngalaxies.

The method\nis explicitly photon-conserving, so the depletion of ionizing photons by\nbound-free opacity is guaranteed to equal the photoionizations these photons\ncaused. As a result, grid cells can be large and very optically-thick without\nloss of accuracy. The method also uses an analytical relaxation solution for\nthe ionization rate equations for each time step which can accommodate time\nsteps which greatly exceed the characteristic ionization and ionization front\ncrossing times. Together, these features make it possible to integrate the\nequation of transfer along a ray with many fewer cells and time steps than\nprevious methods. For multi-dimensional calculations, the code utilizes\nshort-characteristics ray tracing. C^2-Ray is well-suited for coupling\nradiative transfer to gas and N-body dynamics methods, on both fixed and\nadaptive grids, without imposing additional limitations on the time step and\ngrid spacing. We present several tests of the code involving propagation of\nionization fronts in one and three dimensions, in both homogeneous and\ninhomogeneous density fields. We compare to analytical solutions for the\nionization front position and velocity, some of which we derive here for the\nfirst time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2005 10:18:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2005 12:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In this paper, we present new results on a survey for\nlow-mass companions in the Hyades. After measuring precisely the radial\nvelocity of 98 Hyades dwarf stars for 5 years, we have selected all stars that\nshow low-amplitude long-period trends.

The two companions of HIP 16548 have masses between 0.07 to 0.08\nMo, and are thus either brown dwarfs or very low mass stars. In the case of HAN\n172 we found a companion with a mass between 0.08 to 0.10 Mo, which is again\nbetween a star and a brown dwarf. The other seven stars all have stellar\ncompanions. In two additional cases, the RV-variations are presumably caused by\nstellar activity, and in another case the companion could be a short-period\nbinary.

Because at least 12 of the 14 stars\nshowing low-amplitude RV trends turn out to have companions with a mass greater\nthan 70 MJupiter, or are just active, we finally estimate the number of\ncompanions with masses between 10 MJupiter and 70 MJupiter within 8 AU of the\nhost stars in the Hyades as less equal 2%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2005 15:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Campbell\ngeneralized the Huffman problem to a family of problems in which the goal is to\nminimize not mean codeword length but rather a generalized mean known as a\nquasiarithmetic or quasilinear mean. Such generalized means have a number of\ndiverse applications, including applications in queueing. Several\nquasiarithmetic-mean problems have novel simple redundancy bounds in terms of a\ngeneralized entropy. A related property involves the existence of optimal\ncodes: For ``well-behaved'' cost functions, optimal codes always exist for\n(possibly infinite-alphabet) sources having finite generalized entropy. Solving\nfinite instances of such problems is done by generalizing an algorithm for\nfinding length-limited binary codes to a new algorithm for finding optimal\nbinary codes for any quasiarithmetic mean with a convex cost function. This\nalgorithm can be performed using quadratic time and linear space, and can be\nextended to other penalty functions, some of which are solvable with similar\nspace and time complexity, and others of which are solvable with slightly\ngreater complexity. This reduces the computational complexity of a problem\ninvolving minimum delay in a queue, allows combinations of previously\nconsidered problems to be optimized, and greatly expands the space of problems\nsolvable in quadratic time and linear space.

Moreover,\nin the combined limit these heavy pentaquark states fill multiplets of\nSU(4)xO(8)xSU(2). We explore the question of whether corrections in the\ncombined 1/Nc and 1/mQ expansions are sufficiently small to maintain this\nqualitative result. Since no model-independent way is known to answer this\nquestion, we use a class of ``realistic'' hadronic models in which a pentaquark\ncan be formed via nucleon-heavy meson binding through a pion-exchange\npotential. These models have the virtue that they necessarily yield the correct\nbehavior in the combined limit, and the long-distance parts of the interactions\nare model independent.

Elastic scattering is viewed as due to two processes: a) diffraction\nscattering originating from cloud-cloud interaction; b) a hard or large |t|\nscattering originating from one nucleon core scattering off the other via\nvector meson omega exchange, while their outer clouds interact independently.\nThe omega-exchange amplitude shows that omega behaves like an elementary vector\nmeson at high energy, contrary to a regge pole behavior. This behavior,\nhowever, can be understood in the nonlinear sigma-model where omega couples to\na topological baryonic current like a gauge boson, and the nucleon is described\nas a topological soliton. Further investigation shows that the underlying\neffective field theory model is a gauged linear sigma-model that has not only\nthe pion sector and the Wess-Zumino-Witten action of the nonlinear sigma-model,\nbut also a quark-scalar sector. The nucleon structure that emerges is that the\nnucleon has an outer cloud of quark-antiquark condensed ground state, an inner\ncore of topological baryonic charge probed by omega, and a still smaller\nquark-bag containing massless valence quarks. Large |t| pp elastic scattering\nis attributed to valence quark-quark elastic scattering, which is taken to be\ndue to the hard pomeron. The model is applied to predict pp elastic\ndifferential cross section at LHC at c.m. energy 14 TeV and |t| = 0 - 10 GeV*2.\nIf our predicted differential cross section is quantitatively confirmed by\nprecise measurement at LHC by the TOTEM group, then it will indicate that\nvarious novel ideas developed over the last four decades to describe the\nnucleon combine and lead to a unique physical description of its structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2005 19:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-27"}

We\nconsistently truncate the superstring equations of motion to the so-called\nsu(1|1) sector. By fixing the uniform gauge we show that physical excitations\nin this sector are described by two complex fermionic degrees of freedom and we\nobtain the corresponding Lagrangian. Remarkably, this Lagrangian can be cast in\na two-dimensional Lorentz-invariant form. The kinetic part of the Lagrangian\ninduces a non-trivial Poisson structure while the Hamiltonian is just the one\nof the massive Dirac fermion. We find a change of variables which brings the\nPoisson structure to the canonical form but makes the Hamiltonian nontrivial.\nThe Hamiltonian is derived as an exact function of two parameters: the total\nS^5 angular momentum J and string tension \\lambda; it is a polynomial in 1/J\nand in \\sqrt{\\lambda'} where \\lambda'=\\frac{\\lambda}{J^2} is the effective BMN\ncoupling. We identify the string states dual to the gauge theory operators from\nthe closed su(1|1) sector of N=4 SYM and show that the corresponding near-plane\nwave energy shift computed from our Hamiltonian perfectly agrees with that\nrecently found in the literature.

The answer depends on the model of rounded arithmetic:\nWe assume that for any arithmetic operator $op(a,b)$, for example $a+b$ or $a\n\\cdot b$, its computed value is $op(a,b) \\cdot (1 + \\delta)$, where $| \\delta\n|$ is bounded by some constant $\\epsilon$ where $0 < \\epsilon \\ll 1$, but\n$\\delta$ is otherwise arbitrary.

In classical test and verification one\ndevelops a test set separating a correct circuit from a circuit containing any\nconsidered fault. Classical faults are modelled at the logical level by fault\nmodels that act on classical states. The stuck fault model, thought of as a\nlead connected to a power rail or to a ground, is most typically considered. A\nclassical test set complete for the stuck fault model propagates both binary\nbasis states, 0 and 1, through all nodes in a network and is known to detect\nmany physical faults. A classical test set complete for the stuck fault model\nallows all circuit nodes to be completely tested and verifies the function of\nmany gates. It is natural to ask if one may adapt any of the known classical\nmethods to test quantum circuits. Of course, classical fault models do not\ncapture all the logical failures found in quantum circuits. The first obstacle\nfaced when using methods from classical test is developing a set of realistic\nquantum-logical fault models. Developing fault models to abstract the test\nproblem away from the device level motivated our study. Several results are\nestablished. First, we describe typical modes of failure present in the\nphysical design of quantum circuits. From this we develop fault models for\nquantum binary circuits that enable testing at the logical level. The\napplication of these fault models is shown by adapting the classical test set\ngeneration technique known as constructing a fault table to generate quantum\ntest sets. A test set developed using this method is shown to detect each of\nthe considered faults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2005 14:34:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2005 21:20:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 01:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-29"}
