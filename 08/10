A detailed radiative transfer model reproducing the full spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) from 23 micron to 1.3 mm requires a large inner\ncavity of radius 600 AU in the envelope to avoid quenching the emission from\nthe central sources. This is consistent with a previous suggestion based on\nhigh angular resolution millimeter interferometric data. An alternative\ninterpretation using a 2D model of the envelope with an outflow cavity can\nreproduce the SED but not the interferometer visibilities. The cavity size is\ncomparable to the centrifugal radius of the envelope and therefore appears to\nbe a natural consequence of the rotation of the protostellar core, which has\nalso caused the fragmentation leading to the central protostellar binary. With\na large cavity such as required by the data, the average temperature at a given\nradius does not increase above 60-80 K and although hot spots with higher\ntemperatures may be present close to each protostar, these constitute a small\nfraction of the material in the inner envelope.

An analysis of the dependencies of the measured r_h\non both the properties of the GCs themselves and their host galaxies reveals\nthat the average r_h increases with increasing galactocentric distance or,\nalternatively, with decreasing galaxy surface brightness. For the first time,\nwe find that the average r_h decreases with the host galaxy color. We also show\nthat there is no evidence for a variation of r_h with the luminosity of the\nGCs. Finally, we find in agreement with previous observations that the average\nr_h depends on the color of GCs, with red GCs being ~17% smaller than their\nblue counterparts. We show that this difference is probably a consequence of an\nintrinsic mechanism, rather than projection effects, and that it is in good\nagreement with the mechanism proposed in Jordan (2004). We discuss these\nfindings in light of two simple pictures for the origin of the r_h of GCs and\nshow that both lead to a behavior in rough agreement with the observations.\nAfter accounting for the dependencies found we show that the average GC\nhalf-light radii <r_h> can be successfully used as a standard ruler for\ndistance estimation.

We\npresent a simple analytical model for the prediction of cluster-scale X-ray\nobservations, approximating clusters as isothermal systems in hydrostatic\nequilibrium, and dark matter haloes as ellipsoids with uniform axial ratios. We\ntest the model against high-resolution, hydrodynamic cluster simulations to\ngauge its reliability. We find that this simple prescription does a good job of\npredicting the distribution of cluster X-ray ellipticities compared to the\nsimulations as long as one focuses on cluster regions that are less sensitive\nto recent mergers. Based on this simple model, the distribution of cluster-size\nhalo shapes expected in the concordance LCDM cosmology implies an X-ray\nellipticity distribution with a mean of 0.32 +- 0.01 and a scatter of 0.14 +-\n0.01 for the mass range (1-4)x10^{14} Msun/h. We find it important to include\nthe mass dependence of halo shape to make comparisons to observational samples\nthat contain many, very massive clusters. We analyse the systematics of four\nobservational samples of cluster ellipticities and find that our results are\nstatistically compatible with observations. In particular, we find remarkably\ngood agreement between two recent ROSAT samples and LCDM predictions that DO\nNOT include gas cooling. We also test how well our analytical model can predict\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich decrement maps and find that it is less successful although\nstill useful; the model does not perform as well as a function of flux level in\nthis case because of the changing triaxiality of dark matter haloes as a\nfunction of radial distance.

Although the light\nscalar mesons $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ are widely perceived as primarily the\nfour-quark bound states, in practice it is difficult to make quantitative\npredictions based on the four-quark picture for light scalars. Hence,\npredictions are made in the 2-quark model for the scalar mesons. Based on the\nQCD sum rule method, we have derived the leading-twist light-cone distribution\namplitudes of scalar mesons and their decay constants. The short-distance\napproach suffices to explain the observed large rates of $f_0(980)K^-$ and\n$f_0(980)\\bar K^0$ that receive major penguin contributions from the $b\\to\nss\\bar s$ process.

The influence of network topology was varied by using a small-world\nnetwork, a random network and a Barabasi-Albert network. The degree to which\nconsumers value the opinion of their peers was also varied. On a small-world\nand random network we find a phase-transition between an open market and a\nlocked-in market that is similar to condensation in liquids.

On a scale-free network, the model shows a transition\nbetween a gas-like phase and a glassy state, but at the transition point the\nnoise amplitude is much larger than what is seen in supermarket sales.

Networks have been constructed\nafter a two phase filtering, where words with less meaning contents are\neliminated, and all remaining words are set to their canonical form, without\nany number, gender or time flexion. Each sentence in the text is added to the\nnetwork as a clique. A large number of written texts have been scrutinized, and\nits found that texts have small-world as well as scale-free structures. The\ngrowth process of these networks has also been investigated, and a universal\nevolution of network quantifiers have been found among the set of texts written\nby distinct authors. Further analyzes, based on shufling procedures taken\neither on the texts or on the constructed networks, provide hints on the role\nplayed by the word frequency and sentence length distributions to the network\nstructure. Since the meaningful words are related to concepts in the author's\nmind, results for text networks may uncover patterns in communication and\nlanguage processes that occur in the mind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2005 15:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Since, as first formulated by\nEinstein's (1905) equation for the energy, all \"particles\" (neutrons,\nelectrons, photons, etc.) are each characterized by a specific \"frequency\", the\ninverse of this frequency is the smallest operational unit of time available in\nprinciple. With a corresponding \"coarse graining\" of an otherwise practically\nidealized, continuous time (i.e., with the latter then holding on time scales\nmuch larger than the coarse grained one), one can show that the basic features\nof quantum theory can be derived from a minimal set of assumptions. In\nparticular, it is shown here how the Schroedinger equation can be derived from\nclassical physics modified only by said assumption of a coarse grained time and\nthe presence of so-called \"zero-point fluctuations\". The latter relate to the\ndynamics of a \"fluid\" vacuum, which is today known to be a far cry from just\nbeing \"empty space\". Consequently, it is shown that time and matter, when\ndiscussed from a physical point of view, must by necessity be considered in one\ncommon framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2005 20:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We examine the effectiveness of the\ntwo typical sequences: bb sequence consisting of only bit-flips, and bp\nsequence consisting of both bit- and phase-flips.

Such separable operators can be executed much\nfaster than multi-particle operators, such as c-NOT gates and Toffoli gates, in\nmany realistic systems.
