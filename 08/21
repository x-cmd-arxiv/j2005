The\nformation mechanisms are reviewed: mergers, tidal accretion, or gas accretion\nfrom cosmic filaments. The Tully-Fisher diagram for polar rings reveals that\nthe velocity in the polar plane is higher than in the host plane, which can\nonly be explained if the dark matter is oblate and flattened along the polar\nplane. Only a few individual systems have been studied in details, and 3D\nshapes of their haloes determined by several methods.

As we expect, a tight correlation between the normalized SFR by\nstellar mass (SFR/M$_*$) and the H$\\alpha$ equivalent width is found for the\nlate-type galaxies in A2255. The correlation of SFR/M$_*$ with the continuum\nbreak strength at 4000 \\AA is also confirmed. The SFR/M$_*$ - M$_*$ correlation\nis found for both the early- and late-type galaxies, indicating that the star\nformation activity tends to be suppressed when the assembled stellar mass\nM$_*$) increases, and this correlation is tighter and steeper for the late-type\ncluster galaxies. Compared with the mass range of field spiral galaxies, only\ntwo massive late-type galaxies with M$_*>10^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$ are survived in\nA2255, suggesting that the gas disks of massive spiral galaxies could have been\ntidally stripped during cluster formation. Additionally, the SFR variation with\nthe projected radial distance are found to be heavily dependent upon galaxy\nmorphology: the early-type galaxies have a very weak inner decrease in\nSFR/M$_*$, while the inner late-type galaxies tend to have higher SFR/M$_*$\nvalues than the outer late-types. This may suggest that the galaxy-scale\nturbulence stimulated by the merging of subclusters might have played different\nroles on early- and late-type galaxies, which leads to a suppression of the\nstar formation activity for E/S0 galaxies and a SFR enhancement for spiral and\nirregular galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2005 06:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Our goal is to investigate whether merger or interaction events could\nbe at the origin of the radio-AGN activity. Around five of our radio galaxies,\nhosted mainly by early-type galaxies, we detect extended HI in emission. In\nmost cases this HI is distributed in large (up to 190 kpc) and massive (up to\nM(HI) ~ 10^10 M(sun)) disk- or ring-like structures, that show fairly regular\nrotation around the host galaxy. This suggests that in these systems a major\nmerger did occur, but at least several Gyr ago. For the HI-rich radio galaxy B2\n0648+27 we confirm such a merger origin through the detection of a\npost-starburst stellar population that dominates the visible light throughout\nthis system. The timescale of the current episode of radio-AGN activity in our\nHI-rich radio galaxies is many orders of magnitude smaller than the merger\ntimescales. Therefore the radio-AGN activity either started late in the\nlifetime of the merger event, or is not directly related to the merger event at\nall. Another intriguing result is that the HI-rich (> 10^9 M(sun)) radio\ngalaxies in our sample all have compact radio sources, while none of the\nextended radio sources contain these amounts of extended HI. This strongly\nsuggests that there is a relation between the size of the radio jet and the\npresence of large amounts of neutral gas associated with the host galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2005 13:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We infer that the velocity, emissivity and\nfield structure in NGC 315 are very similar to those of the other\nlow-luminosity sources we have modelled, but that all of the physical scales\nare larger by a factor of about 5. We derive an inclination to the line of\nsight of 38 degrees for the jets. Where they first brighten, their on-axis\nvelocity is approximately v/c = 0.9. They decelerate to v/c = 0.4 between 8 and\n18 kpc from the nucleus and the velocity thereafter remains constant. The speed\nat the edge of the jet is roughly 0.6 of the on-axis value where it is best\nconstrained, but the transverse velocity profile may deviate systematically\nfrom the Gaussian form we assume. The proper emissivity profile is split into\nthree power-law regions separated by shorter transition zones. In the first of\nthese, at 3 kpc (the flaring point) the jets expand rapidly at constant\nemissivity, leading to a large increase in the observed brightness on the\napproaching side. At 10 kpc, the emissivity drops abruptly by a factor of 2.\nWhere the jets are well resolved their rest-frame emission is\ncentre-brightened.

We give a theoretical analysis of the particle motions in such\nexperiments. Our analysis reveals that the proximity of the tethered bead to a\nnearby surface (the microscope slide) gives rise to a volume-exclusion effect,\nresulting in an entropic force on the molecule. This force stretches the\nmolecule, changing its statistical properties. In particular, the proximity of\nbead and surface brings about intriguing scaling relations between key\nobservables (statistical moments of the bead) and parameters such as the bead\nsize and contour length of the molecule. We present both approximate analytic\nsolutions and numerical results for these effects in both flexible and\nsemiflexible tethers. Finally, our results give a precise,\nexperimentally-testable prediction for the probability distribution of the\ndistance between the polymer attachment point and the center of the mobile\nbead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2005 17:58:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2005 01:27:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The process is characterized by the rates: k for\nthe polymer to make a diffusive jump through the pore, q for unbinding of a\nchaperone, and the rate q kappa for binding (with a binding strength kappa);\nexcept for the case of no binding kappa=0 the presence of the chaperones give\nrise to an effective force that drives the translocation process.
