We analyze the reverse-forward shocks in a wind environment,\nincluding their dynamics and emission. An early afterglow is emitted from the\nshocked shell, e.g., an optical flash may emerge. The reverse shock behaves\ndifferently in two approximations: relativistic and Newtonian cases, which\ndepend on the parameters, e.g., the initial Lorentz factor of the ejecta. If\nthe initial Lorentz factor is much less than $114 E_{53}^{1/4}\n\\Delta_{0,12}^{-1/4} A_{*,-1}^{-1/4}$, the early reverse shock is Newtonian.\nThis may take place for the wider of a two-component jet, an orphan afterglow\ncaused by a low initial Lorentz factor, and so on.

Both NGC 2264 clumps are located in\nthe Mon OB1 giant molecular cloud complex, adjacent to one another. Twelve and\nfifteen compact millimeter continuum sources (i.e. MMSs) are identified in\nclumps C and D, respectively. Evidence for widespread infall motions is found\nin, e.g., HCO+(3-2) or CS(3-2) in both NGC 2264-C and NGC 2264-D. A sharp\nvelocity discontinuity ~ 2 km/s in amplitude is observed in N_2H+(1-0) and\nH^{13}CO+(1-0) in the central, innermost part of NGC 2264-C, which we interpret\nas the signature of a strong dynamical interaction between two MMSs and their\npossible merging with the central MMS C-MM3. Radiative transfer modelling\nsupports the idea that NGC 2264-C is a highly unstable prolate clump in the\nprocess of collapsing along its long axis on a near free-fall dynamical\ntimescale ~ 1.7x10^5 yr. Our model fit of this large-scale collapse suggests a\nmaximum mass inflow rate ~ 3x10^{-3} Msun/yr toward the central protostellar\nobject C-MM3. Such infall rates are sufficiently high to overcome radiation\npressure and allow the formation of ~ 20 Msun stars by accretion in ~ 1.7x10^5\nyr, i.e., a time similar to the global dynamical timescale of the central part\nof NGC 2264-C. We conclude that we are likely witnessing the formation of a\nhigh-mass (> 10 Msun) protostar in the central part of NGC 2264-C. Our results\nsuggest a picture of massive star formation intermediate between the scenario\nof stellar mergers of Bonnell et al.

As the influence of market\nstructure on stock prices may be obscured by exogenous factors such as demand\nand supply, we hypothesize that modulation of the flow of transactions due to\nmarket operations may carry a stronger imprint of the internal market\nmechanism. We analyse times between consecutive transactions (ITT) for NYSE and\nNASDAQ stocks, and we relate the dynamical properties of the ITT with those of\nthe corresponding price fluctuations. We find a robust scale-invariant temporal\norganisation in the ITT of stocks which is independent of individual company\ncharacteristics and industry sector, but which depends on market structure. We\nfind that stocks registered on the NASDAQ exhibit stronger correlations in\ntheir transaction timing within a trading day, compared with NYSE stocks.\nFurther, we find that companies that transfer from the NASDAQ to the NYSE show\na reduction in the correlation strength of transaction timing within a trading\nday, after the move, suggesting influences of market structure. Surprisingly,\nwe also observe that stronger power-law correlations in the ITT are coupled\nwith stronger power-law correlations in absolute price returns and higher price\nvolatility, suggesting a strong link between the dynamical properties of ITT\nand the corresponding price fluctuations over a broad range of time scales.\nComparing the NYSE and NASDAQ, we demonstrate that the higher correlations we\nfind in ITT for NASDAQ stocks are matched by higher correlations in absolute\nprice returns and by higher volatility, suggesting that market structure may\naffect price behaviour through information contained in transaction timing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2005 21:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

Certain features, usually thought of as specifically quantum, turn out\nto be generic in this framework, meaning that they are present in all except\nclassical theories. These include the non-unique decomposition of a mixed state\ninto pure states, a theorem involving disturbance of a system on measurement\n(suggesting that the possibility of secure key distribution is generic), and a\nno-cloning theorem. Two particular theories are then investigated in detail,\nfor the sake of comparison with the classical and quantum cases. One of these\nincludes states that can give rise to arbitrary non-signalling correlations,\nincluding the super-quantum correlations that have become known in the\nliterature as Nonlocal Machines or Popescu-Rohrlich boxes.

The existence of such correlations forces much of the dynamics in\nthis theory to be, in a certain sense, classical, with consequences for\nteleportation, cryptography and computation.

It is possible to extend the dynamical law associated\nwith the evolution of a quantum state consistently to include a nonlinear\nstochastic component, while respecting the conservation law. According to the\ndynamics thus obtained, referred to as the energy-based stochastic Schrodinger\nequation, an arbitrary initial state collapses spontaneously to one of the\nenergy eigenstates, thus describing the phenomenon of quantum state reduction.\nIn this article, two such models are investigated: one that achieves state\nreduction in infinite time, and the other in finite time.

By use of a novel application of a nonlinear filtering\nmethod, closed-form solutions--algebraic in character and involving no\nintegration--are obtained for both these models.
