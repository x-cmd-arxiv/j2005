However, it is possible to make\nprobabilistic hazard assessments for earthquake risk. These are primarily based\non the association of small earthquakes with future large earthquakes. In this\npaper we discuss a new approach to earthquake forecasting. This approach is\nbased on a pattern informatics (PI) method which quantifies temporal variations\nin seismicity. The output is a map of areas in a seismogenic region\n(``hotspots'') where earthquakes are forecast to occur in a future 10-year time\nspan. This approach has been successfully applied to California, to Japan, and\non a worldwide basis. These forecasts are binary--an earthquake is forecast\neither to occur or to not occur. The standard approach to the evaluation of a\nbinary forecast is the use of the relative operating characteristic (ROC)\ndiagram, which is a more restrictive test and less subject to bias than maximum\nlikelihood tests. To test our PI method, we made two types of retrospective\nforecasts for California. The first is the PI method and the second is a\nrelative intensity (RI) forecast based on the hypothesis that future\nearthquakes will occur where earthquakes have occurred in the recent past.\nWhile both retrospective forecasts are for the ten year period 1 January 2000\nto 31 December 2009, we performed an interim analysis 5 years into the\nforecast. The PI method out performs the RI method under most circumstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2005 19:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

The\nquasiparticles are the perturbative QCD ladders. We find, within the WKB\napproximation, that the smallness of the QCD coupling constant ensures the\nhierarchy among many-quasiparticle interactions evaluated within physical\nvacuum and in particular, the dominance in the Lagrangian of the triple\nquasiparticle interaction. It is explained that the effective field theory\nconsidered near the perturbative QCD vacuum contains a tachyon relevant for the\ndivergency of the perturbative QCD series at sufficiently small $x$. We solve\nthe equations of motion of the effective field theory within the WKB\napproximation and find the physical vacuum and the transitions between the\nfalse (perturbative) and physical vacua. Classical solutions which dominate\ntransitions between the false and physical vacua are kinks that cannot be\ndecomposed into perturbative series over the powers of $\\alpha_s$.

Remarkably, no one has been\nable to provide exponential improvement on a 100-year-old lower bound on the\nmaximal packing density due to Minkowski in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space\n$\\Re^d$. The asymptotic behavior of this bound is controlled by $2^{-d}$ in\nhigh dimensions. Using an optimization procedure that we introduced earlier\n\\cite{To02c} and a conjecture concerning the existence of disordered sphere\npackings in $\\Re^d$, we obtain a provisional lower bound on the density whose\nasymptotic behavior is controlled by $2^{-0.7786... d}$, thus providing the\nputative exponential improvement of Minkowski's bound. The conjecture states\nthat a hard-core nonnegative tempered distribution is a pair correlation\nfunction of a translationally invariant disordered sphere packing in $\\Re^d$\nfor asymptotically large d if and only if the Fourier transform of the\nautocovariance function is nonnegative. The conjecture is supported by two\nexplicit analytically characterized disordered packings, numerical simulations\nin low dimensions, known necessary conditions that only have relevance in very\nlow dimensions, and the fact that we can recover the forms of known rigorous\nlower bounds. A byproduct of our approach is an asymptotic lower bound on the\naverage kissing number whose behavior is controlled by $2^{0.2213... d}$, which\nis to be compared to the best known asymptotic lower bound on the individual\nkissing number of $2^{0.2075... d}$.

When these action\npotentials have essentially equivalent waveforms, all information is contained\nin the interspike intervals (ISIs) of the spike sequence. We address the\nquestion: How do neural circuits recognize and read these ISI sequences?\n  Our answer is given in terms of a biologically inspired neural circuit that\nwe construct using biologically realistic neurons. The essential ingredients of\nthe ISI Reading Unit (IRU) are (i) a tunable time delay circuit modelled after\none found in the anterior forebrain pathway of the birdsong system and (ii) a\nrecently observed rule for inhibitory synaptic plasticity. We present a circuit\nthat can both learn the ISIs of a training sequence using inhibitory synaptic\nplasticity and then recognize the same ISI sequence when it is presented on\nsubsequent occasions. We investigate the ability of this IRU to learn in the\npresence of two kinds of noise: jitter in the time of each spike and random\nspikes occurring in the ideal spike sequence. We also discuss how the circuit\ncan be detuned by removing the selected ISI sequence and replacing it by an ISI\nsequence with ISIs drawn from a probability distribution.\n  We have investigated realizations of the time delay circuit using\nHodgkin-Huxley conductance based neurons connected by realistic excitatory and\ninhibitory synapses. Our models for the time delay circuit are tunable from\nabout 10 ms to 100 ms allowing one to learn and recognize ISI sequences within\nthat range of ISIs. ISIs down to a few ms and longer than 100 ms are possible\nwith other intrinsic and synaptic currents in the component neurons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2005 17:04:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2005 22:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

New species are introduced through mutation. Both models are\namenable to exact linear stability analysis, and we compare the analytic\nresults with large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, obtaining the\npopulation size as a function of an average interspecies interaction strength.\nOver time, the models self-optimize through mutation and selection to\napproximately maximize a community fitness function, subject only to\nconstraints internal to the particular model. If the interspecies interactions\nare randomly distributed on an interval including positive values, the system\nevolves toward self-sustaining, mutualistic communities. In contrast, for the\npredator-prey case the matrix of interactions is antisymmetric, and a nonzero\npopulation size must be sustained by an external resource. Time series of the\ndiversity and population size for both models show approximate 1/f noise and\npower-law distributions for the lifetimes of communities and species. For the\nmutualistic model, these two lifetime distributions have the same exponent,\nwhile their exponents are different for the predator-prey model. The difference\nis probably due to greater resilience toward mass extinctions in the food-web\nlike communities produced by the predator-prey model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2005 19:59:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2006 22:08:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 May 2007 22:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}
