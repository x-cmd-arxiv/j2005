We examine the properties of a large sample of 104\ncluster early-types as a function of cluster radius and local density, using\nthem as sensitive tracers of the various physical processes that may be\nresponsible for galaxy evolution. By constructing the Fundamental Plane of Cl\n0024, we infer an evolution in the mean mass to light ratio of early-types\nequal to \\Delta<Log (M/L_V)> = -0.14 +- 0.02. In the cluster center, we detect\na significantly increased scatter in the relationship compared to that seen in\nlocal clusters. Moreover, we observe a clear radial trend in the mass to light\nratios of individual early types, with the oldest galaxies located in the\ncluster core. Galaxies are apparently younger at larger radius, with E+S0s in\nthe periphery having M/L_V ratios that nearly match values seen in the field at\na similar redshift. Independent spectral indicators used in combination reveal\nan abrupt interaction with the cluster environment which occurs near the virial\nradius of Cl 0024, revealed by small bursts of star formation in a population\nof dim early-types, as well as by enhanced Balmer absorption for a set of\nlarger E+S0s closer to the cluster core. We construct a simple infall model\nused to compare the timescales and strengths of the observed interactions in\nthis cluster. We examine the possibility that bursts of star formation are\ntriggered when galaxies suffer shocks as they encounter the intra-cluster\nmedium, or by the onset of galaxy harassment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2005 22:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Rates of convergence depend on the smoothness of the\nfunctional coefficient and on the point in which the prediction is made.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2005 11:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

The\nunion of all lines from both families is called a cage, and the intersection X\nconsists of d^2 points at which a line from the first family intersects a line\nfrom the second. The points of X are called the nodes of the cage. We study the\nsubsets A of the nodal set X such that any plane algebraic curve C of degree d\nthat contains A must contain X as well.

Quantum-state tomography is further proposed to\nexperimentally confirm the generation of these states. The decays of the\nprepared EPR pairs are analyzed using numerical simulations.
