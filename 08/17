El\nGamal, Mammen, Prabhakar and Shah (2004) showed that the delay associated with\nthis throughput scales as $\\Theta(n\\log n)$, when each node moves according to\nan independent random walk. In a later work, Diggavi, Grossglauser and Tse\n(2002) considered a random network on a sphere with a restricted mobility\nmodel, where each node moves along a randomly chosen great circle on the unit\nsphere. They showed that even with this one-dimensional restriction on\nmobility, constant throughput scaling is achievable. Thus, this particular\nmobility restriction does not affect the throughput scaling. This raises the\nquestion whether this mobility restriction affects the delay scaling.\n  This paper studies the delay scaling at $\\Theta(1)$ throughput for a random\nnetwork with restricted mobility. First, a variant of the scheme presented by\nDiggavi, Grossglauser and Tse (2002) is presented and it is shown to achieve\n$\\Theta(1)$ throughput using different (and perhaps simpler) techniques.

Thus, this particular mobility restriction \\emph{does\nnot} affect either the maximal throughput scaling or the corresponding delay\nscaling of the network.

Evidence for a smooth transition from cusps to partons is\nfound. First, each cusp yields D-2 normal-coordinate bound states with\nprotected frequencies (for p>2 there are additional bound states); and can\nmoreover be related to a short open p-brane whose tension diverges at the AdS\nboundary leading to a decoupled singular CFT at the ``brane at the\nend-of-the-universe''. Second, discretizing the closed p-brane and keeping the\nnumber N of discrete partons finite yields an sp(2N)-gauged phase-space sigma\nmodel giving rise to symmetrized N-tupletons of the minimal higher-spin algebra\nho_0(D-1,2)\\supset so(D-1,2). The continuum limit leads to a 2d chiral\nsp(2)-gauged sigma model which is critical in D=7; equivalent a la\nBars-Vasiliev to an su(2)-gauged spinor string; and furthermore dual to a WZW\nmodel in turn containing a topological \\hat{so}(6,2)_{-2}/(\\hat{so}(6)\\oplus\n\\hat\\so(2))_{-2} coset model with a chiral ring generated by singleton-valued\nweight-0 spin fields. Moreover, the two-parton truncation can be linked via a\nreformulation a la Cattaneo-Felder-Kontsevich to a topological open string on\nthe phase space of the D-dimensional Dirac hypercone. We present evidence that\na suitable deformation of the open string leads to the Vasiliev equations based\non vector oscillators and weak sp(2)-projection. Geometrically, the bi-locality\nreflects broken boundary-singleton worldlines, while Vasiliev's intertwiner\nkappa can be seen to relate T and R-ordered deformations of the boundary and\nthe bulk of the worldsheet, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2005 13:51:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2005 15:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2006 14:34:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-05"}

The reduction of variational Runge-Kutta\ndiscretizations is considered, as well as the extent to which symmetry\nreduction and discretization commute. These reduced methods allow the direct\nsimulation of dynamical features such as relative equilibria and relative\nperiodic orbits that can be obscured or difficult to identify in the unreduced\ndynamics. The methods are demonstrated for the dynamics of an Earth orbiting\nsatellite with a non-spherical $J_2$ correction, as well as the double\nspherical pendulum. The $J_2$ problem is interesting because in the unreduced\npicture, geometric phases inherent in the model and those due to numerical\ndiscretization can be hard to distinguish, but this issue does not appear in\nthe reduced algorithm, where one can directly observe interesting dynamical\nstructures in the reduced phase space (the cotangent bundle of shape space), in\nwhich the geometric phases have been removed. The main feature of the double\nspherical pendulum example is that it has a nontrivial magnetic term in its\nreduced symplectic form. Our method is still efficient as it can directly\nhandle the essential non-canonical nature of the symplectic structure. In\ncontrast, a traditional symplectic method for canonical systems could require\nrepeated coordinate changes if one is evoking Darboux' theorem to transform the\nsymplectic structure into canonical form, thereby incurring additional\ncomputational cost.

In the\nenhancement quantum dots, just one electron can be brought into initially empty\ndot, in contrast to depletion mode dots based on expelling of electrons from\nmulti-electron dots by gates. The quantum computer architectures based on\ndepletion dots are confronted by several challenges making scalability\ndifficult. These challenges can be successfully met by the approach based on\nehnancement mode, capable of producing square array of dots with versatile\nfunctionalities. These functionalities allow transportation of qubits,\nincluding teleportation, and error correction based on straightforward one- and\ntwo-qubit operations. We describe physical properties and demonstrate\nexperimental characteristics of enhancement quantum dots and single-electron\ntransistors based on InAs/GaSb composite quantum wells. We discuss the\nmaterials aspects of quantum dot quantum computing, including the materials\nwith large spin splitting such as InAs, as well as perspectives of enhancement\nmode approach in materials such as Si.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2005 06:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
