Thus, recently there has been tremendous\ninterest in generating realistic network topologies. Such work must begin with\nan understanding of existing network topologies, which today typically consists\nof a relatively small number of data sources. In this paper, we calculate an\nextensive set of important characteristics of Internet AS-level topologies\nextracted from the three data sources most frequently used by the research\ncommunity: traceroutes, BGP, and WHOIS. We find that traceroute and BGP\ntopologies are similar to one another but differ substantially from the WHOIS\ntopology.

We find that, among metrics widely considered, the joint degree\ndistribution appears to fundamentally characterize Internet AS-topologies: it\nnarrowly defines values for other important metrics. We also introduce an\nevaluation criteria for the accuracy of topology generators and verify previous\nobservations that generators solely reproducing degree distributions cannot\ncapture the full spectrum of critical topological characteristics of any of the\nthree topologies. Finally, we release to the community the input topology\ndatasets, along with the scripts and output of our calculations.
