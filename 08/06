We compare isothermal models to models including\ncooling with a simple but self-consistent treatment of the coupling between\ngas, grains and radiation field temperatures. The hydrostatic equilibrium\nappears to hold past the marginally stable state, until the collapse proceeds.\nThe last hydrostatic state before collapse has a lower central gas temperature\nin the centre due to the enhanced coupling between gas, grains and radiation\nfield. This results in slightly lower pressure gradients in the bulk of the\nenvelope which is hence slightly more extended than in the isothermal case. Due\nto the sensitivity of the collapse on these initial conditions, protostellar\ninfall velocities in the envelope turn out to be much slower in the case with\ncooling.Our models also compute the radiative transfer and a rather large\nchemical network coupled to gas dynamics. However, we note that the\nsteady-state chemisorption of CO is sufficient to provide an accurate cooling\nfunction of the gas.

Two classical problems come together in this model: the\nLandau-Zener and the Rabi problem. The probability of Landau-Zener transitions\nnow depends sensitively on the amplitude, the frequency and the phase of the\nRabi interaction. The influence of the static phase turns out to be\nparticularly strong, since this parameter controls the time-reversal symmetry\nof the Hamiltonian. In the limits of large and small frequencies, analytical\nresults obtained within a rotating-wave approximation compare favourably with a\nnumerically exact solution. Some physical realizations of the model are\ndiscussed, both in microwave optics and in magnetic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2005 17:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
