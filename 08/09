Theoretical work in the 1930s predicted the absence of bond\nalternation in the limit of infinitely long conjugated polymers; a result later\ncontradicted by experimental investigations. When this issue was re-examined in\nthe 1950s it was shown in the adiabatic limit that bond alternation occurs for\nany value of electron-phonon coupling. The question of whether this conclusion\nremains valid for quantized nuclear degrees of freedom was first addressed in\nthe 1980s. Since then a series of numerical calculations on models with gapped,\ndispersionless phonons have suggested that bond alternation is destroyed by\nquantum fluctuations below a critical value of electron-phonon coupling. In\nthis work we study a more realistic model with gapless, dispersive phonons. By\nsolving this model with the DMRG method we show that bond alternation remains\nrobust for any value of electron-phonon coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2005 12:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

A comparison of the theory with the data suggests that the\ntruncated sum rules in the three-level model give a reasonable fundamental\nlimit. Our ansatz that the two photon absorption cross-section near the limit\nmust have only three dominant statesis is supported by a rigorous analytical\ncalculation that the resonant term gets smaller as more states are added. We\nalso find that the contributions of the non-explicitly resonant terms can not\nbe neglected when analyzing real molecules with many excited states, even near\nresonance. However, puzzling as it may be, extrapolating an off-resonant result\nto resonance using only the resonant term of the three-level model is shown to\nbe consistent with the exact result. In addition, the off-resonant\napproximation is shown to scale logarithmically when compared with the full\nthree-level model. This scaling can be used to simplify the analysis of\nmeasurements. We find that existing molecules are still far from the\nfundamental limit; so, there is room for improvement. But, reaching the\nfundamental limit would require precise control of the energy-level spacing,\nindependently of the transition dipole moments -- a task that does not appear\npossible using today's synthetic approaches. So, we present alternative methods\nthat can still lead to substantial improvements which only require the control\nof the transition moment to the first excited state. While it is best to\nnormalize measured two photon absorption cross-sections to the fundamental\nlimits when comparing molecules, we show that simply dividing by the square of\nthe number of electrons per molecule yields a good metric for comparison.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2005 01:40:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2005 19:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In past years, many good quantum error-correcting codes had\nbeen derived as binary stabilizer codes. Fault-tolerant quantum computation\nprompted the study of nonbinary quantum codes, but the theory of such codes is\nnot as advanced as that of binary quantum codes. This paper describes the basic\ntheory of stabilizer codes over finite fields. The relation between stabilizer\ncodes and general quantum codes is clarified by introducing a Galois theory for\nthese objects. A characterization of nonbinary stabilizer codes over GF(q) in\nterms of classical codes over GF(q^2) is provided that generalizes the\nwell-known notion of additive codes over GF(4) of the binary case. This paper\nderives lower and upper bounds on the minimum distance of stabilizer codes,\ngives several code constructions, and derives numerous families of stabilizer\ncodes, including quantum Hamming codes, quadratic residue codes, quantum Melas\ncodes, quantum BCH codes, and quantum character codes. The puncturing theory by\nRains is generalized to additive codes that are not necessarily pure. Bounds on\nthe maximal length of maximum distance separable stabilizer codes are given. A\ndiscussion of open problems concludes this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2005 21:09:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2005 20:42:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

We derive analytic formulas for the\nthreshold and critical exponent of this phase transition from a mean-field\napproach. Numerical simulations of the microscopic dynamics reveal that, on\nlaboratory timescale, a hysteresis masks the mean-field behaviour. Simple\nphysical arguments explain this phenomenon and provide analytical expressions\nfor the observable threshold.
