RE 1034+39 has an unusually hard\nspectral energy distribution (SED) that peaks in the soft X-rays. Its emission\nlines are unusual in that they can all be modelled as a Lorentzian centered at\nthe rest wavelength with only a small range in velocity widths. In order to\ninvestigate whether the unusual SED influences the emission line ratios and\nequivalent widths, we present three complementary types of photoionization\nanalysis. The FUSE spectrum was particularly important because it includes the\nhigh-ionization line OVI. First, we use the photoionization code Cloudy and the\nSED developed from the coordinated observations to confirm that the emission\nlines are consistent with observed hard SED. The best model parameters were an\nionization parameter log(U) ~ -2 and a hydrogen number density log(n_H)=9.75\n[cm^-2]. Second, we present a Locally Optimally-emitting Cloud model. This\nmodel produced enhanced OVI as observed, but also yielded far too strong MgII.\nThird, we develop a series of semi-empirical SEDs, run Cloudy models, and\ncompare the results with the measured values using a figure of merit (FOM). The\nFOM minimum indicates similar SED and gas properties as were inferred from the\none-zone model using the RE 1034+39 continuum. Furthermore, the FOM increases\nsharply toward softer continua, indicating that a hard SED is required by the\ndata in the context of a one-zone model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2005 19:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is found that, in the view of the mass\nevolution of hosting haloes in the CDM model, bright LBGs are consistent with\nbeing the progenitor of the OPEGs, whereas it is less likely that the LBG\npopulation, as a whole, have evolved into the OPEG population. It is also found\nthat the present-day descendants of both the bright LBGs and OPEGs are likely\nto be located in massive systems such as groups of galaxies or clusters of\ngalaxies. Finally, we estimate the hosting halo mass of local early-type galaxy\nsamples from the 2dF and SDSS based on the halo model and it turns out that\ntheir expected characteristic mass of hosting haloes is in good agreement with\nthe EPS predictions for the descendant's mass of both the bright LBGs and\nOPEGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2005 02:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The\nanisotropy constants D and B are measured with minor hysteresis loops. A\ntransverse field is used to tune the tunnel splitting over a large range. Using\nthe LZ and inverse LZ method, it is shown that these interactions play an\nimportant role in the tunnel rates. Three regions are identified: (i) at small\ntransverse fields, tunneling is dominated by single tunnel transitions; (ii) at\nintermediate transverse fields, the measured tunnel rates are governed by\nreshuffling of internal fields, (iii) at larger transverse fields, the\nmagnetization reversal starts to be influenced by the direct relaxation\nprocess, and many-body tunnel events may occur. The hole digging method is used\nto study the next-nearest neighbor interactions. At small external fields, it\nis shown that magnetic ordering occurs which does not quench tunneling. An\napplied transverse field can increase the ordering rate. Spin-spin\ncross-relaxations, mediated by dipolar and weak exchange interactions, are\nproposed to explain additional quantum steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2005 15:43:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Using\nnearest neighbor, one-dimensional Cellular Automata (CA) as an example, we show\nhow to construct local coarse-grained descriptions of CA in all classes of\nWolfram's classification. The resulting coarse-grained CA that we construct are\ncapable of emulating the large-scale behavior of the original systems without\naccounting for small-scale details. Several CA that can be coarse-grained by\nthis construction are known to be universal Turing machines; they can emulate\nany CA or other computing devices and are therefore undecidable. We thus show\nthat because in practice one only seeks coarse-grained information, complex\nphysical systems can be predictable and even decidable at some level of\ndescription. The renormalization group flows that we construct induce a\nhierarchy of CA rules. This hierarchy agrees well with apparent rule complexity\nand is therefore a good candidate for a complexity measure and a classification\nmethod. Finally we argue that the large scale dynamics of CA can be very\nsimple, at least when measured by the Kolmogorov complexity of the large scale\nupdate rule, and moreover exhibits a novel scaling law. We show that because of\nthis large-scale simplicity, the probability of finding a coarse-grained\ndescription of CA approaches unity as one goes to increasingly coarser scales.\nWe interpret this large scale simplicity as a pattern formation mechanism in\nwhich large scale patterns are forced upon the system by the simplicity of the\nrules that govern the large scale dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2005 22:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The idea of this paper is that the self-similar transformations of\none postulated basic matter create the fundamental dynamic fractal elements of\nthe universe. The elements are described with equation of unifying interaction\ndrawn into their fundamental framework. The equation transforms into the\ninverse square laws, the principle of uncertainty, Maxwell equations of\nelectromagnetic field and into MOND like expression after modification of its\nparameters at the scales where these laws and principle are found to hold. The\nintroduced equation is also confirmed with calculations based on the orbital\ndata for bodies that move around the nucleus of the Milky Way Galaxy, the\ncenters of the Earth and the Sun and orbit the huge 87 Sylvia asteroid. The\npuzzling constant sunward force that acts on the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft,\nthe flat rotational curves of stars far from the galactic nuclei, the nature of\ndark matter and the enigmatic cosmic repulsion are explained in terms of\ncontracting and expanding 3D-spirally-faster-inward-oscillating vortexes of\nbasic matter, called dynamic fractals. The latter create new fundamental\nframework, which allows qualitative and quantitative modeling by fitting of the\nparameters of the equation of unifying interaction to experimental data. The\ncalculations based on the proposed dynamic fractal framework are in agreement\nwith the considered orbital data. Many testable predictions are made and\nnatural hazard precursors are suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2005 16:42:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2005 13:30:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2005 10:44:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2005 08:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
