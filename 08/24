The development of astrometric facilities operating from space at a\nmicroarcsecond level of precision makes the non-uniformity of the galactic\nmotion of the barycenter an observable effect that violates the inertiality of\nthe barycentric frame. Most of the observable effect is caused by secular\nacceleration of the barycenter with respect to the center of the Galaxy. The\nacceleration results in a pattern of secular aberration which is observable\nastrometrically as a systematic vector field of the proper motions of distant\nquasars. We employ the vector spherical harmonics to describe the predicted\nfield of the proper motions and evaluate its amplitude at each point on the\ncelestial sphere.

Firstly, we concluded that\nthe motion of the interfacial water molecules can only be in a limited angular\nrange, instead rapidly varying over a broad angular range in the vibrational\nrelaxation time suggested previously. Secondly, because different vibrational\nmodes of different molecular species at the interface has different symmetry\nproperties, polarization and symmetry analysis of the SFG-VS spectral features\ncan help assignment of the SFG-VS spectra peaks to different interfacial\nspecies.

Despite the\nspectacular success of the algorithm in many application areas such as\niterative decoding, computer vision and combinatorial optimization which\ninvolve graphs with many cycles, theoretical results about both correctness and\nconvergence of the algorithm are known in few cases (Weiss-Freeman Wainwright,\nYeddidia-Weiss-Freeman, Richardson-Urbanke}.\n  In this paper we consider the problem of finding the Maximum Weight Matching\n(MWM) in a weighted complete bipartite graph. We define a probability\ndistribution on the bipartite graph whose MAP assignment corresponds to the\nMWM. We use the max-product algorithm for finding the MAP of this distribution\nor equivalently, the MWM on the bipartite graph. Even though the underlying\nbipartite graph has many short cycles, we find that surprisingly, the\nmax-product algorithm always converges to the correct MAP assignment as long as\nthe MAP assignment is unique. We provide a bound on the number of iterations\nrequired by the algorithm and evaluate the computational cost of the algorithm.\nWe find that for a graph of size $n$, the computational cost of the algorithm\nscales as $O(n^3)$, which is the same as the computational cost of the best\nknown algorithm. Finally, we establish the precise relation between the\nmax-product algorithm and the celebrated {\\em auction} algorithm proposed by\nBertsekas. This suggests possible connections between dual algorithm and\nmax-product algorithm for discrete optimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2005 18:37:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2007 01:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-06"}
