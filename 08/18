First the implications of hitherto neglected non-linearities\nof the Boltzmann equation for the dynamical evolution of the shearing sheet are\ninvestigated. Using a formalism developed previously on the basis of the\nlinearized Boltzmann equation it is demonstrated that the inclusion of the\nnon-linear term leads to a feedback cycle for swing amplified density waves in\nthe unbounded shearing sheet. Such a feedback is unique to star disks and is\nnot known for gas disks. In order to present concrete examples of the\nnon-linear feedback cycle a SCF code was developed and numerical simulations of\nthe dynamical evolution of the shearing sheet are performed. The numerical\nresults seem to confirm the theoretical predictions. The evolution of the\nshearing sheet resembles closely and might actually explain the recurrent\nspiral instabilities found in large-scale numerical simulations of the\ndynamical evolution of galactic disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2005 10:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This technique is of great value because the alternative, a\nstate-by-state summation over final states, is generally not feasible. The most\ncelebrated application is to the Gamow-Teller operator, which governs beta\ndecay and neutrino reactions in the allowed limit. The Lanczos procedure\ndetermines the nuclear response along a line q=0 in the (omega,q) plane, where\nomega and q are the energy and three-momentum transfered to the nucleus.\nHowever, generalizing such treatments from the allowed limit to general\nelectroweak response functions at arbitrary momentum transfers seems\nconsiderably more difficult: the response function must be determined over the\nentire (omega,q) plane for an operator O(q) that is not fixed, but depends\nexplicitly on q. Such operators arise in any semileptonic process where the\nmomentum transfer is comparable to (or larger than) the inverse nuclear size.\nHere we show, for Slater determinants built on harmonic oscillator basis\nfunctions, that the nuclear response for any multipole operator O(q) can be\ndetermined efficiently over the full response plane by a generalization of the\nstandard Lanczos moments method. We describe the Piecewise Moments Method and\nthoroughly explore its convergence properties for the test case of\nelectromagnetic responses in a full sd-shell calculation of 28Si.
