These two objects are\noriginally selected as i'-dropouts (i'-z' > 1.5) showing an interesting\nphotometric property, the ``NB921 depression''. The NB921-band (centered at\n9196A) magnitude is significantly depressed with respect to the z'-band\nmagnitude. The optical spectra of these two objects exhibit asymmetric\nemission-lines at lambda_obs ~ 8540A and ~ 8560A, suggesting that these objects\nare Ly_alpha emitters at z~6. The rest-frame equivalent widths of the Ly_alpha\nemission of the two objects are 94A and 236A; the latter one is the Ly_alpha\nemitter with the largest Ly_alpha equivalent width at z > 6 ever\nspectroscopically confirmed. The spectroscopically measured Ly_alpha fluxes of\nthese two objects are consistent with the interpretation that the NB921\ndepression is caused by the contribution of the strong Ly_alpha emission to the\nz'-band flux. Most of the NB921-depressed i'-dropout objects are thought to be\nstrong Ly_alpha emitters at 6.0 < z < 6.5; Galactic L and T dwarfs and\nNB921-dropout galaxies at z > 6.6 do not dominate the NB921-depressed\ni'-dropout sample. Thus the NB921-depression method is very useful for finding\nhigh-z Ly_alpha emitters with a large Ly_alpha equivalent width over a large\nredshift range, 6.0 < z < 6.5. Although the broadband-selected sample at z ~ 3\ncontains only a small fraction of objects with a Ly_alpha equivalent width\nlarger than 100A, the i'-dropout sample of the Subaru Deep Field contains a\nmuch larger fraction of such strong Ly_alpha emitters. This may imply a strong\nevolution of the Ly_alpha equivalent width from z > 6 to z ~ 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2005 18:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In the dispersive regime, the correlation between the cavity field\nand each Cooper-pair box results in an effective interaction between CPBs that\ncan be used to dynamically generate maximally entangled states. With only\ncollective manipulations, we show how to create maximally entangled quantum\nstates and how to use these states to reach the Heisenberg limit in the\ndetermination of a spectroscopy frequency. This scheme can be applied to other\ntypes of superconducting qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2005 00:20:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Exploiting entanglement swapping, quantum relay could\noffer ways to extend the achievable distance by increasing the signal to noise\nratio. In this letter we present an experimental simulation of long distance\nquantum communication, in which the superiority of quantum relay is\ndemonstrated. Assisted by quantum relay, we greatly extend the distance limit\nof unconditional secure quantum communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2005 18:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is shown that a very similar picture of a circularly\npolarized coherent wave can account for both the spin of an electron and its\nquantum wave function, in a Lorentz-invariant fashion. The photon-electron\ninteraction occurs through the usual electromagnetic potentials, modulating the\nfrequency and wavevector (energy and momentum) of this rotating spin field.\nOther quantum particles can also be represented either as rotating spin fields,\nor as composites of such fields. Taken together, this picture suggests an\nalternative interpretation of quantum mechanics based solely on coherent wave\npackets, with no point particles present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2005 22:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Specifically, the entropy behavior in the low temperature limit,\nwhich caused debates in the literature, is analyzed. It is stressed that the\nbehavior of the relaxation frequency in the $T\\to0$ limit does not play a\nphysical role since the anomalous skin effect dominates in this range. In\ncontrast with the previous works, where the approximate Leontovich impedance\nwas used for analysis of nonlocal effects, we give description of the problem\nin terms of exact nonlocal impedances. It is found that the Casimir entropy is\ngoing to zero at $T\\to0$ only in the case when $s$ polarization does not\ncontribute to the classical part of the Casimir force. However, the entropy\napproaching zero from the negative side that, in our opinion, cannot be\nconsidered as thermodynamically satisfactory. The resolution of the negative\nentropy problem proposed in the literature is analyzed and it is shown that it\ncannot be considered as complete. The crisis with the thermal Casimir effect is\nstressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2005 15:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
