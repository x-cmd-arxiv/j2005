The\ndegree of disagreement is a strong function of aperture and magnitude (ranging\nfrom 20% to more than a factor of 2). We also find that the photometry in the\nfive optical bands can be highly correlated for both point sources and\ngalaxies, although the correlation for point sources is almost entirely due to\nvariable objects.

While this analysis\nrequires us to posit a form for the frequency-dependent quasiparticle\nconductivity, we clearly demonstrate that the extraction of the relaxation rate\nis quite insensitive to the assumed shape of the quasiparticle spectrum. The\nrobustness of the analysis is rooted in the oscillator-strength sum rule and\nthe fact that we simultaneously measure the real and imaginary parts of the\nconductivity. In both Bi2212 and Tl2201 we infer a linear temperature\ndependence of the transport relaxation rate 1/tau and a small but finite\nzero-temperature intercept. The linear temperature dependence of 1/tau is in\naccord with expectations for weak elastic scattering in an unconventional\nsuperconductor with line nodes and a small residual density of states. The same\nanalysis reveals an onset of inelastic scattering at higher temperatures\nsimilar to that seen in the YBCO superconductors.

We use a specific\nexample of colliding brane worlds to illustrate the phase diagram of this\ncosmological framework. The collision provides the necessary initial\ncosmological instability, expressed as a departure from conformal invariance in\nthe underlying string model. The brane motion provides a way of breaking\ntarget-space supersymmetry, and leads to various phases of the brane and bulk\nUniverses. Specifically, we find a hot metastable phase for the bulk string\nUniverse soon after the brane collision in which supersymmetry is broken, which\nwe describe by means of a subcritical world-sheet sigma model dressed by a\nspace-like Liouville field, representing finite temperature (Euclidean time).\nThis phase is followed by an inflationary phase for the brane Universe, in\nwhich the bulk string excitations are cold. This is described by a\nsuper-critical Liouville string with a time-like Liouville mode, whose zero\nmode is identified with the Minkowski target time. Finally, we speculate on\npossible ways of exiting the inflationary phase, either by means of subsequent\ncollisions or by deceleration of the brane Universe due to closed-string\nradiation from the brane to the bulk. While phase transitions from hot to cold\nconfigurations occur in the bulk string universe, stringy excitations attached\nto the brane world remain thermalized throughout, at a temperature which can be\nrelatively high.

The spectral zeta function and integrated heat kernel are\nconstructed for different branches of the spectrum in an explicit form. As a\npreliminary, the rigorous procedure of integration over the continuous spectra\nis formulated by introducing the spectral densityin terms of the scattering\nphase shifts.

Using\nstandard exact 3-dimensional lattice model we evolve sequences starting from\nrandom ones and determining exact native structure after each mutation.\nAcceptance of mutations is biased to select for stable proteins. We found that\ncertain structures, wonderfold, are independently discovered numerous times as\nnative states of stable proteins in many unrelated runs of selection. Diversity\nof sequences that fold into wonderfold structures gives rise to superfamilies,\ni.e. sets of dissimilar sequences that fold into the same or very similar\nstructures. Wonderfolds appear to be the most designable structures out of\ncomplete set of compact lattice proteins. Furthermore, proteins having\nwondefolds as their native structure tend to be most thermostable among all\nevolved proteins. This effect is purely due to the favorable geometric\nproperties of wonderfolds and, thus, dominates any dependence on sequences. The\npresent work establishes a model of prebiotic structure selection, which\nidentifies dominant structural patterns emerging upon optimization of proteins\nfor survival in hot environment.
