Since condensates, unlike photons, are\ninteracting, they may permit the realization of specific quantum states needed\nas input of an interferometer to approach the Heisenberg limit, the supposed\nlower bound to precision phase measurements. To this end, we study the\nsensitivity to external weak perturbations of a representative matter-wave\nMach-Zehnder interferometer whose input are two Bose-Einstein condensates\ncreated by splitting a single condensate in two parts. The interferometric\nphase sensitivity depends on the specific quantum state created with the two\ncondensates, and, therefore, on the time scale of the splitting process. We\nidentify three different regimes, characterized by a phase sensitivity $\\Delta\n\\theta$ scaling with the total number of condensate particles $N$ as i) the\nstandard quantum limit $\\Delta \\theta \\sim 1/N^{1/2}$, ii) the sub shot-noise\n$\\Delta \\theta \\sim 1/N^{3/4}$ and the iii) the Heisenberg limit $\\Delta \\theta\n\\sim 1/N$. However, in a realistic dynamical BEC splitting, the 1/N limit\nrequires a long adiabaticity time scale, which is hardly reachable\nexperimentally. On the other hand, the sub shot-noise sensitivity $\\Delta\n\\theta \\sim 1/N^{3/4}$ can be reached in a realistic experimental setting. We\nalso show that the $1/N^{3/4}$ scaling is a rigorous upper bound in the limit\n$N \\to \\infty$, while keeping constant all different parameters of the bosonic\nMach-Zehnder interferometer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2005 18:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

By context-tree prediction, we\nrefer to a family of prediction schemes, where at each time instant $t$, after\nhaving observed all outcomes of the data sequence $x_1,...,x_{t-1}$, but not\nyet $x_t$, the prediction is based on a ``context'' (or a state) that consists\nof the $k$ most recent past outcomes $x_{t-k},...,x_{t-1}$, where the choice of\n$k$ may depend on the contents of a possibly longer, though limited, portion of\nthe observed past, $x_{t-k_{\\max}},...x_{t-1}$. This is different from the\nstudy reported in [1], where general finite-state predictors as well as\n``Markov'' (finite-memory) predictors of fixed order, were studied in the\nregime of individual sequences.\n  Another important difference between this study and [1] is the asymptotic\nregime. While in [1], the resources of the predictor (i.e., the number of\nstates or the memory size) were kept fixed regardless of the length $N$ of the\ndata sequence, here we investigate situations where the number of contexts or\nstates is allowed to grow concurrently with $N$. We are primarily interested in\nthe following fundamental question: What is the critical growth rate of the\nnumber of contexts, below which the performance of the best context-tree\npredictor is still universally achievable, but above which it is not? We show\nthat this critical growth rate is linear in $N$. In particular, we propose a\nuniversal context-tree algorithm that essentially achieves optimum performance\nas long as the growth rate is sublinear, and show that, on the other hand, this\nis impossible in the linear case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2005 23:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}
