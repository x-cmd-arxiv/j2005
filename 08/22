To extend a popular\nsystem (which many programmers are using) with the ability of combining crisp\nand fuzzy knowledge representations seems to be an interesting issue.\n  Our first work (Fuzzy Prolog) was a language that models\n$\\mathcal{B}([0,1])$-valued Fuzzy Logic. In the Borel algebra,\n$\\mathcal{B}([0,1])$, truth value is represented using unions of intervals of\nreal numbers. This work was more general in truth value representation and\npropagation than previous works.\n  An interpreter for this language using Constraint Logic Programming over Real\nnumbers (CLP(${\\cal R}$)) was implemented and is available in the Ciao system.\n  Now, we enhance our former approach by using default knowledge to represent\nincomplete information in Logic Programming. We also provide the implementation\nof this new framework. This new release of Fuzzy Prolog handles incomplete\ninformation, it has a complete semantics (the previous one was incomplete as\nProlog) and moreover it is able to combine crisp and fuzzy logic in Prolog\nprograms. Therefore, new Fuzzy Prolog is more expressive to represent real\nworld.\n  Fuzzy Prolog inherited from Prolog its incompleteness. The incorporation of\ndefault reasoning to Fuzzy Prolog removes this problem and requires a richer\nsemantics which we discuss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2005 07:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We study the chiral properties of our limiting\ntheory in Chapter 3, for naive as well as Wilson fermions, and obtain a\nrecursive relation for the chiral condensate. In Chapter 4, we obtain the\nhomogeneous integral equation satisfied by the meson states of our theory.\nComparison of this equation with the corresponding one for the 't~Hooft model\nallows us to infer many physical meson properties.

Assembly\nmodels are developed for viral capsids built from protein building blocks that\ncan assume different local bonding structures in the capsid. This situation\noccurs, for example, for viruses in the family of Papovaviridae, which are\nlinked to cancer and are hence of particular interest for the health sector.\nMore specifically, the viral capsids of the (pseudo-) T=7 particles in this\nfamily consist of pentamers that exhibit two different types of bonding\nstructures. While this scenario cannot be described mathematically in terms of\nCaspar-Klug Theory (Caspar and Klug 1962), it can be modelled via tiling theory\n(Twarock 2004). The latter is used to encode the local bonding environment of\nthe building blocks in a combinatorial structure, called the assembly tree,\nwhich is a basic ingredient in the derivation of assembly models for\nPapovaviridae along the lines of the equilibrium approach of Zlotnick (Zlotnick\n1994). A phase space formalism is introduced to characterize the changes in the\nassembly pathways and intermediates triggered by the variations in the\nassociation energies characterizing the bonds between the building blocks in\nthe capsid. Furthermore, the assembly pathways and concentrations of the\nstatistically dominant assembly intermediates are determined.
