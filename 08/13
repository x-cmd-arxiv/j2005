Our simulations have yielded a\nnew model for quasar lifetimes where the lifetime depends on both the\ninstantaneous and peak quasar luminosities. This motivates a new interpretation\nof the QLF in which the bright end consists of quasars radiating at nearly\ntheir peak luminosities, but the faint end is mostly made up of quasars in less\nluminous phases of evolution. The faint-end QLF slope is then determined by the\nfaint-end slope of the quasar lifetime for quasars with peak luminosities near\nthe observed break. We determine this slope from the quasar lifetime as a\nfunction of peak luminosity, based on a large set of simulations spanning a\nwide variety of host galaxy, merger, BH, and ISM gas properties. Brighter peak\nluminosity (higher BH mass) systems undergo more violent evolution, and expel\nand heat gas more rapidly in the final stages of quasar evolution, resulting in\na flatter faint-end slope (as these objects fall below the observed break in\nthe QLF more rapidly). Therefore, as the QLF break luminosity moves to higher\nluminosities with increasing redshift, implying a larger typical quasar peak\nluminosity, the faint-end QLF slope flattens. From the quasar lifetime as a\nfunction of peak luminosity and this interpretation of the QLF, we predict the\nfaint-end QLF slope and its evolution with redshift in good agreement with\nobservations. Although BHs grow anti-hierarchically (with lower-mass BHs formed\nprimarily at lower redshifts), the observed change in slope and differential or\nluminosity dependent density evolution in the QLF is completely determined by\nthe luminosity-dependent quasar lifetime and physics of quasar feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2005 21:04:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2005 18:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-28"}

We propose an observational test for the determination of the\ndominant planet-formation channel. Based on the sequential-accretion (hereafter\nSA) model, we identify several potential avenues which may lead to the prolific\nformation of a population of close-in earth-mass ($M_\\oplus$) planets\n(hereafter close-in earths) around stars with 1) short-period or 2) solitary\neccentric giants and 3) systems which contain intermediate-period resonant\ngiants.

As a specific example, we suggest\nthat the SA processes led to the formation of the 7.5 $M_\\oplus$ planet around\nGJ 876 and predict that it may have an atmosphere and envelope rich in O$_2$\nand liquid water.

In this limit, the electrons\nare confined to specific orbits in the scaled space, yet the uncertainty\nprinciple is maintained because the scaling leaves invariant the\nposition-momentum commutator. A first-order perturbation correction,\nproportional to 1/D, substantially improves the agreement with the exact ground\nstate potential energy curve. The present treatment is very simple\nmathematically, yet provides a strikingly accurate description of the potential\nenergy curves for the lowest singlet, triplet and excited states of H_2.

The noise occurs\non a very short-time scale compared to that for the neuron dynamics and it\nproduces short-time synaptic depression. This is inspired in recent\nneurobiological findings that show that synaptic strength may either increase\nor decrease on a short-time scale depending on presynaptic activity. We thus\ndescribe a mechanism by which fast presynaptic noise enhances the neural\nnetwork sensitivity to an external stimulus. The reason for this is that, in\ngeneral, the presynaptic noise induces nonequilibrium behavior and,\nconsequently, the space of fixed points is qualitatively modified in such a way\nthat the system can easily scape from the attractor. As a result, the model\nshows, in addition to pattern recognition, class identification and\ncategorization, which may be relevant to the understanding of some of the brain\ncomplex tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2005 10:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
