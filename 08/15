In addition, we have traced the distribution of\nother molecules, such as H13CO+, SiO, HCO, and HC3N. These data, together with\nthe reactive ions recently detected, have been considered to determine the\nphysical conditions and to model the PDR chemistry. We then identified two kind\nof molecules. The first group, formed by the reactive ions (CO+, HOC+) and\nsmall hydrocarbons (C2H, C3H2), traces the surface layers of the PDR and is\npresumably exposed to a high UV field (hence we called it as \"high UV\", or\nHUV). HUV species is expected to dominate for visual absorptions 2 < Av < 5\nmag. A second group (less exposed to the UV field, and hence called \"low UV\",\nor LUV) includes HCO and SiO, and is mainly present at the edges of the PDR (Av\n> 5 mag). While the abundances of the HUV molecules can be explained by gas\nphase models, this is not the case for the studied LUV ones. Although some\nefficient gas-phase reactions might be lacking, grain chemistry sounds like a\nprobable mechanism able to explain the observed enhancement of HCO and SiO.\nWithin this scenario, the interaction of UV photons with grains produces an\nimportant effect on the molecular gas chemistry and constitutes the first\nevidence of an ionization front created by the UC HII region carving its host\nmolecular cloud. The physical conditions and kinematics of the gas layer which\nsurrounds the UC HII region were derived from the HUV molecules. Molecular\nhydrogen densities > 4 10^6 cm^(-3) are required to reproduce the observations.\nSuch high densities suggest that the HII region could be pressure-confined by\nthe surrounding high density molecular gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2005 19:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Researchers have concentrated in two-player-two\nstrategy, 2x2, dilemma containing classical games, and transferred them into\nquantum realm showing that in quantum pure strategies dilemmas in such games\ncan be resolved if entanglement is distributed between the players armed with\nquantum operations. Moreover, it became clear that the players receive the\nhighest sum of payoffs available in the game, which are otherwise impossible in\nclassical pure strategies. Encouraged by the observation of rich dynamics of\nphysical systems with many interacting parties and the power of entanglement in\nquantum versions of 2x2 games, it became generally accepted that quantum\nversions can be easily extended to N-player situations by simply allowing\nN-partite entangled states. In this article, however, we show that this is not\ngenerally true because the reproducibility of classical tasks in quantum domain\nimposes limitations on the type of entanglement and quantum operators. We\npropose a benchmark for the evaluation of quantum and classical versions of\ngames, and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a physical\nrealization.
