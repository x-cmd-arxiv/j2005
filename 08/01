Our calculations\nrely on deep Blazar radio counts that we derived combining several\nmultifrequency surveys. The integrated Blazar emission yields a broad-band\nnon-thermal background that in some parts of the e.m. spectrum dominates the\nextragalactic brightness. Blazars are the main point-like contributors to the\nCMB. Their integrated emission causes an apparent T increase of 5-50 muK in the\n50-250 GHz range. The CMB fluctuation spectrum is sensibly contaminated at\nl>300, for a Poissonian source distribution, or at lower l values if spatial\nclustering is present. We estimate that well over 100,000 Blazars will produce\na significant signal in the PLANCK CMB anisotropy maps. Because of the\nmicrowave-Xray flux correlation, these sources are expected to have flux > a\nfew 10^{-15} erg/s in the soft X-ray band. Thus, a large fraction of the\nforeground sources in CMB anisotropy maps could be identified and removed using\na multi frequency approach, provided that a sufficiently deep all sky X-ray\nsurvey will be available. We further show that Blazars are a major constituent\nof all high-E extragalactic backgrounds. Their contribution is 11-12% at X-ray\nfrequencies and possibly 100% in the 0.5-50 MeV band. At E>100 MeV, the Blazar\ncollective emission, obtained extrapolating their integrated micro-wave flux to\nthe gamma-ray band using the SED of EGRET detected sources, over-predicts the\nextragalactic background by a large factor, implying that Blazars not only\ndominate the gamma-ray sky but also that their average duty cycle at these\nfrequencies must be rather low. We also find that Blazars of the HBL type may\nproduce a significant amount of flux at TeV energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2005 10:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our\nsimulations are based on a mixed numerical method with Lattice Boltzmann\nequation and finite difference scheme for Navier-Stokes and order parameter\nequations, respectively. We focus on cases where banded flows are observed with\ntwo different slopes for the component of velocity in the direction of the\napplied flow.

The local behavior of the stress shows that the\nsystem with the coexisting lamellar and SIS regions is in mechanical\nequilibrium. This phenomenon occurs, at fixed viscosity, for shear rates under\na certain threshold; when the imposed shear rate is sufficiently large,\nlamellar order develops in the whole system.

When doped with one\ncharge carrier, the ground state has momenta (\\pm\\pi,0) and (0,\\pm\\pi). On\nfurther doping, charge carriers are unbound and the momentum distribution\nfunction can be constructed from that of the single-carrier ground state. The\nFermi surface resembles that of small pockets at single charge carrier ground\nstate momenta, which is the expected result in a lightly doped antiferromagnet.\nThis feature persists upon doping up to the largest doping level we achieved.\nWe therefore do not observe the Fermi surface changing shape at doping levels\nup to 0.125.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2005 08:14:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2006 07:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

First, the formulation of gauge theory of gravity in\narbitrary curvilinear coordinates is given. Then in spherical coordinates\nsystem, a spherical symmetric solution of the field equation of gravitational\ngauge field is obtained, which is just the Schwarzschild solution. In gauge\ntheory of gravity, the equation of motion of a classical mass point in\ngravitational gauge field is given by Newton's second law of motion. A\nrelativistic form of the gravitational force on a mass point is deduced in this\npaper. Based on the spherical symmetric solution of the field equation and\nNewton's second law of motion, we can discuss classical tests of gauge theory\nof gravity, including the deflection of light by the sun, the precession of the\nperihelia of the orbits of the inner planets and the time delay of radar echoes\npassing the sun. It is found that the theoretical predictions of these\nclassical tests given by gauge theory of gravity are completely the same as\nthose given by general relativity. From the study in this paper, an important\nqualitative conclusion on the nature of gravity is that gravity can be treated\nas a kind of physical interactions in flat Minkowski space-time, and the\nequation of motion of mass point in gravitational field can be given by\nNewton's second law of motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2005 15:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

After an heuristic approach, we show how a\nlinear truncation in the Taylor expansion can generate an algebra of symmetry\ncharacterized by some structure functions. Such a linear truncation is\nexplicitly realized by introducing the notion of Forsyth frame over the Riemann\nsurface with the help of a conformally covariant algebraic differential\nequation. The large chiral diffeomorphism action is then implemented through a\nB.R.S. formulation (for a given order of truncation) leading to a more\nalgebraic set up. In this context the ghost fields behave as holomorphically\ncovariant jets. Subsequently, the link with the so called W-algebras is made\nexplicit once the ghost parameters are turned from jets into tensorial ghost\nones. We give a general solution with the help of the structure functions\npertaining to all the possible truncations lower or equal to the given order.\nThis provides another contribution to the relationship between KdV flows and\nW-diffeomorphims\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2005 09:28:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2006 15:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Results: We describe the first analysis of C. elegans individuals\nsampled directly from natural populations. C. elegans is found predominantly in\nthe dauer stage and with a very low frequency of males compared with\nhermaphrodites. While C. elegans was previously shown to display a low\nworldwide genetic diversity, we find by comparison a surprisingly high local\ngenetic diversity of C. elegans populations; this local diversity is\ncontributed in great part by immigration of new alleles rather than by\nmutation. Our results on heterozygote frequency, male frequency and linkage\ndisequilibrium furthermore show that selfing is the predominant mode of\nreproduction in C. elegans natural populations, yet that infrequent outcrossing\nevents occur, at a rate of approximately 1%.
