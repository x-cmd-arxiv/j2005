We show that the classical viscous damping is unimportant\nfor magnetically dominated or low beta plasmas and the primary damping\nmechanism is the collisionless damping by the background particles. We show\nthat the damping rate is proportional to the total random momentum density of\nthe particles. For solar flare conditions this means that in most flares,\nexcept the very large ones, the damping is dominated by thermal background\nelectrons. For large flares one requires acceleration of essentially all\nbackground electrons into a nonthermal distribution so that the accelerated\nelectrons can be important in the damping of the waves. In general, damping by\nthermal or nonthermal protons is negligible compared to that of electrons\nexcept for quasi-perpendicular propagating waves or for rare proton dominated\nflares with strong nuclear gamma-ray line emission. Using the rate for damping\nwe determine the critical scale below which the damping becomes important and\nthe spectrum of the turbulence steepens. This critical scale, however, has\nstrong dependence on the angle of propagation with respect to the magnetic\nfield direction. The waves can cascade down to very small scales, such as the\ngyroradii of the particles at small angles (quasi-parallel propagation) and\npossibly near 90 degree (quasi-perpendicular propagation) giving rise to a\nhighly anisotropic spectral distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2005 19:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It leads naturally to the introduction of\ncompound parameters describing physical properties of the system. Often one of\nthe variables of interest is the object dimension, or time. The prevalence of a\nsimple power law over the entire range of dimensions or times can be helpfully\ninterpreted as size or time independence of the corresponding compound physical\nparameter of the system. However, it is also often found that a simple power\nlaw only persists for some extreme values, e.g. for very large and/or small\nsizes, or very short or long times. Transitions between regimes of different\npower law asymptotic behaviour are encountered frequently in the description of\na wide variety of physical systems.

However, due to the\nlocal approximations nature of the BST formalism, the iterative version of this\ntechnique possibly does not yield the true optimum solution. In this work, an\nalgorithm is proposed to obtain the correct and consistent optimum steady-state\noperating point of biochemical systems. The existing linear optimization\nproblem of the direct IOM approach is modified by adding an equality constraint\nof describing the consistency of solutions between the S-system and the\noriginal model. Lagrangian analysis is employed to derive the first order\nnecessary optimality conditions for the above modified optimization problem.\nThis leads to a procedure that may be regarded as a modified iterative IOM\napproach in which the optimization objective function includes an extra linear\nterm. The extra term contains a comparison of metabolite concentration\nderivatives with respect to the enzyme activities between the S-system and the\noriginal model and ensures that the new algorithm is still carried out within\nlinear programming techniques. The presented framework is applied to several\nbiochemical systems and shown to the tractability and effectiveness of the\nmethod.
