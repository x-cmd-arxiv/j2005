Since most stars form in embedded star clusters with different masses\nthe IGIMF becomes an integral of the assumed (universal or invariant) stellar\nIMF over the embedded star-cluster mass function (ECMF). For a range of\nreasonable assumptions about the IMF and the ECMF we find the IGIMF to be\nsteeper (containing fewer massive stars per star) than the stellar IMF, but\nbelow a few Msol it is invariant and identical to the stellar IMF for all\ngalaxies. However, the steepening sensitively depends on the form of the ECMF\nin the low-mass regime. Furthermore, observations indicate a relation between\nthe star formation rate of a galaxy and the most massive young stellar cluster\nin it. The assumption that this cluster mass marks the upper end of a\nyoung-cluster mass function leads to a connection of the star formation rate\nand the slope of the IGIMF above a few Msol.

We have\nfound a much higher ERO rate than other sub-mm surveys, due to the increased\ndepth in the optical images. The median photometric redshift (and quartile\nrange), from optical and near-infrared data, is 1.7 (1.3-2.5) for the\nradio-detected sub-mm sources, and rises to 2.3 (1.3-2.7) for the\nradio-undetected sub-sample.

Within this approach, equivalent current limits on\nthe WIMP-nucleon interaction at WIMP mass of 50 GeV/c$^{2}$ are either\n$\\sigma_{p}\\leq0.7$ pb, $\\sigma_{n}\\leq0.2$ pb or $|a_{p}|\\leq0.4$,\n$|a_{n}|\\leq0.7$ depending on the choice of cross section or coupling strength\nrepresentation. These limits become less restrictive for either larger or\nsmaller masses; they are less restrictive than those from the traditional odd\ngroup approximation regardless of WIMP mass. Combination of experimental\nresults are seen to produce significantly more restrictive limits than those\nobtained from any single experiment. Experiments traditionally considered\nspin-independent are moreover found to severely limit the spin-dependent phase\nspace. The extension of this analysis to the case of positive signal\nexperiments is explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2005 15:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The source of the Earth's activity\nlies in the difference of the angular velocities of the mantle and of the solid\ninner core. The friction between both spheres infers heat, which is the cause\nof the melted iron which constitutes most of the liquid outer core, as well as\nthe source of the global heat flow. The solid inner core angular velocity is\nsupposed to remain steady, while the mantle angular velocity depends on\ngyroscopic forces (involving acceleration) and slowing down due to external\nattractions and, principally the motions of mantle plates 2900 km thick. The\nvariations of the geomagnetic field are therefore the direct consequence of the\nvariations of the angular velocity of the mantle relative to that of the inner\ncore. As a result, the biological and tectonic evolutions during geological\ntimes are due to those phenomena. So, the limits of eras coincide exactly with\nthe passage to zero of the geomagnetic field. Here we show that cycles of about\n230-250 millions years, which exhibit the correlation between the mantle\nangular velocity variations, the geomagnetic variations, and therefore the\nclimate, allow us to predict future events : the current global warming which\nparallels the Earth's magnetic field decrease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2005 19:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

Moreover, the\ngeometric phase in the evolution of the eigenspace of an adiabatic action\noperator is also addressed, which is elaborated by a pullback U(N)-bundle.\nSeveral intriguing physical examples are illustrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2005 14:56:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2005 14:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
