From the Tully-Fisher relation, a galaxy with\nthis velocity width would be expected to be 12th magnitude or brighter; however\ndeep CCD imaging has failed to turn up a counterpart down to a\nsurface-brightness level of 27.5 B mag/sq. arcsec. The HI observations show\nthat it is extended over at least 16 kpc which, if the system is bound, gives\nit a minimum dynamical mass of ~10^11 M_solar and a mass to light ratio of\nM_dyn/L_B > 500 M_solar/L_solar. If it is tidal debris then the putative\nparents have vanished; the remaining viable explanation is that VIRGOHI21 is a\ndark halo that does not contain the expected bright galaxy. This object was\nfound because of the low column density limit of our survey, a limit much lower\nthan that achieved by all-sky surveys such as HIPASS. Further such sensitive\nsurveys might turn up a significant number of the dark matter halos predicted\nby Dark Matter models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2005 10:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Lattice field theory provides a\nfirst principles approach to the study of strongly interacting systems such as\nthis through Monte Carlo simulation. Results of exploratory simulations are\npresented here. In particular, the finite temperature phase transition between\nsuperfluid and normal states is studied. We present first results for the\ncritical temperature T_c and describe the future work necessary to determine\nT_c as a function of interaction strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2005 18:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Multivariate regular\nvariation provides a rich description of extremal dependence in the case of\nasymptotic dependence, but fails to distinguish between exact independence and\nasymptotic independence. Hidden regular variation addresses this problem by\nrequiring components of the random vector to be simultaneously large but on a\nsmaller scale than the scale for the marginal distributions. In doing so,\nhidden regular variation typically restricts attention to that part of the\nprobability space where all variables are simultaneously large. However, since\nunder asymptotic independence the largest values do not occur in the same\nobservation, the region where variables are simultaneously large may not be of\nprimary interest.

The datasets are obtained mainly by using the\nyeast hybrid method, which contains false-positive and false-negative\nsimultaneously. Accordingly, while it is desirable to test such datasets\nthrough further wet experiments, here we invoke recent developed network theory\nto test such high throughput datasets in a simple way. Based on the fact that\nthe key biological processes indispensable to maintaining life are universal\nacross eukaryotic species, and the comparison of structural properties of the\nprotein interaction networks (PINs) of the two species with those of the yeast\nPIN, we find that while the worm and the yeast PIN datasets exhibit similar\nstructural properties, the current fly dataset, though most comprehensively\nscreened ever, does not reflect generic structural properties correctly as it\nis. The modularity is suppressed and the connectivity correlation is lacking.\nAddition of interlogs to the current fly dataset increases the modularity and\nenhances the occurrence of triangular motifs as well. The connectivity\ncorrelation function of the fly, however, remains distinct under such interlogs\naddition, for which we present a possible scenario through an in silico\nmodeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2005 06:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This method then\nbecomes a powerful research tool to cover many different branches of physics.\nIndeed, the concept and methodology in one branch of physics can be translated\ninto another through the common mathematical formalism. Coupled oscillators\nprovide clear illustrative examples for some of the current issues in physics,\nincluding entanglement and Feynman's rest of the universe. In addition, it is\nnoted that the present form of quantum mechanics is largely a physics of\nharmonic oscillators. Special relativity is the physics of the Lorentz group\nwhich can be represented by the group of two-by-two matrices commonly called\n$SL(2,c)$. Thus the coupled harmonic oscillators can play the role of combining\nquantum mechanics with special relativity.
