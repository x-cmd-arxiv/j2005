Observations have shown that at least 20% of these\nplanets, including some with particularly high eccentricities, are orbiting a\ncomponent of a wide binary star system. The presence of a distant binary\ncompanion can cause significant secular perturbations to the orbit of a planet.\nIn particular, at high relative inclinations, a planet can undergo a\nlarge-amplitude eccentricity oscillation. This so-called \"Kozai mechanism\" is\neffective at a very long range, and its amplitude is purely dependent on the\nrelative orbital inclination. In this paper, we address the following simple\nquestion: assuming that every host star with a detected giant planet also has a\n(possibly unseen, e.g., substellar) distant companion, with reasonable\ndistributions of orbital parameters and masses, how well could secular\nperturbations reproduce the observed eccentricity distribution of planets? Our\ncalculations show that the Kozai mechanism consistently produces an excess of\nplanets with very high (e >0.6) and very low (e < 0.1) eccentricities. The\npaucity of near-circular orbits in the observed sample cannot be explained\nsolely by the Kozai mechanism, because, even with high enough inclinations, the\nKozai mechanism often fails to produce significant eccentricity perturbations\nwhen there are other competing sources of orbital perturbations on secular\ntimescales, such as general relativity. On the other hand, the Kozai mechanism\ncan produce many highly eccentric orbits. Indeed the overproduction of high\neccentricities observed in our models could be combined with plausible\ncircularizing mechanisms (e.g., friction from residual gas) to create more\nintermediate eccentricities (e=0.1-0.6).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2005 10:36:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2005 22:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This mechanism, for which the name of\n'dichroic maser' is proposed, can operate when a low density molecular cloud is\nilluminated by an anisotropic source of radiation (like for instance a nearby\nstar).

The polarization of\nthe maser radiation is linear and is directed tangentially to a ring\nequidistant to the central star.

In\nthe exact quantization rule, in addition to $N\\pi$, there is an integral term,\ncalled the quantum correction. For the exactly solvable systems we find that\nthe quantum correction is an invariant, independent of the number of nodes in\nthe wave function. In those systems, the energy levels of all the bound states\ncan be easily calculated from the exact quantization rule and the solution for\nthe ground state, which can be obtained by solving the Riccati equation. With\nthis new method, we re-calculate the energy levels for the one-dimensional\nsystems with a finite square well, with the Morse potential, with the symmetric\nand asymmetric Rosen-Morse potentials, and with the first and the second\nP\\\"{o}schl-Teller potentials, for the harmonic oscillators both in one\ndimension and in three dimensions, and for the hydrogen atom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2005 08:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

We use a\nsingle-compartment conductance-based model for medium spiny striatal neurons in\norder to show the effects of parametrization of individual ion channels on the\nneuronal activation function. We show that parameter changes within the\nphysiological ranges are sufficient to create an ensemble of neurons with\nsignificantly different activation functions. We emphasize that the effects of\nintrinsic neuronal variability on spiking behavior require a distributed mode\nof synaptic input and can be eliminated by strongly correlated input. We show\nhow variability and adaptivity in ion channel conductances can be utilized to\nstore patterns without an additional contribution by synaptic plasticity (SP).\nThe adaptation of the spike response may result in either \"positive\" or\n\"negative\" pattern learning. However, read-out of stored information depends on\na distributed pattern of synaptic activity to let intrinsic variability\ndetermine spike response.
