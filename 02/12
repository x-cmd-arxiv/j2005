The\nYork method consists of choosing a 3-metric on a given manifold; a\ndivergence-free, tracefree (TT) symmetric 2-tensor wrt this metric; and a\nsingle number, the trace of the extrinsic curvature. One then obtains a\nquasi-linear elliptic equation for a scalar function, the Lichnerowicz-York\n(L-Y) equation. The solution of this equation is used as a conformal factor to\ntransform the data into a set that satisfies the constraints. If the manifold\nis compact and without boundary, one quantity that emerges is the volume of the\nphysical space. This article reinterprets the L-Y equation as an eigenvalue\nequation so as to get a set of data with a preset physical volume. One chooses\nthe conformal metric, the TT tensor, and the physical volume, while regarding\nthe trace of the extrinsic curvature as a free parameter. The resulting\nequation has extremely nice uniqueness and existence properties. A even more\nradical approach would be to fix the base (conformal) metric, the physical\nvolume, and the trace. One also selects a TT tensor, but one is free to\nmultiply it by a constant(unspecified). One then solves the L-Y equation as an\neigenvalue equation for this constant. A third choice would be to fix the TT\ntensor and and multiply the base metric by a constant.

The COT system is digitized and read out by 315 TDC\ncards, each serving 96 wires of the chamber. The TDC is physically configured\nas a 9U VME card. The functionality is almost entirely programmed in firmware\nin two Altera Stratix FPGA's. The special capabilities of this device are the\navailability of 840 MHz LVDS inputs, multiple phase-locked clock modules, and\nabundant memory. The TDC system operates with an input resolution of 1.2 ns.\nEach input can accept up to 7 hits per collision. The time-to-digital\nconversion is done by first sampling each of the 96 inputs in 1.2-ns bins and\nfilling a circular memory; the memory addresses of logical transitions (edges)\nin the input data are then translated into the time of arrival and width of the\nCOT pulses. Memory pipelines with a depth of 5.5 $\\mu$s allow deadtime-less\noperation in the first-level trigger. The TDC VME interface allows a 64-bit\nChain Block Transfer of multiple boards in a crate with transfer-rates up to 47\nMbytes/sec.

The physical simplicity ensures\nlow-maintenance; the functionality being in firmware allows reprogramming for\nother applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2005 16:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-20"}

We\nshow that a lower bound on the minimal size is provided by the length of the\nminimal geodesic between U and the identity, I, where length is defined by a\nsuitable Finsler metric on SU(2^n). The geodesic curves of such a metric have\nthe striking property that once an initial position and velocity are set, the\nremainder of the geodesic is completely determined by a second order\ndifferential equation known as the geodesic equation. This is in contrast with\nthe usual case in circuit design, either classical or quantum, where being\ngiven part of an optimal circuit does not obviously assist in the design of the\nrest of the circuit. Geodesic analysis thus offers a potentially powerful\napproach to the problem of proving quantum circuit lower bounds. In this paper\nwe construct several Finsler metrics whose minimal length geodesics provide\nlower bounds on quantum circuit size, and give a procedure to compute the\ncorresponding geodesic equation. We also construct a large class of solutions\nto the geodesic equation, which we call Pauli geodesics, since they arise from\nisometries generated by the Pauli group. For any unitary U diagonal in the\ncomputational basis, we show that: (a) provided the minimal length geodesic is\nunique, it must be a Pauli geodesic; (b) finding the length of the minimal\nPauli geodesic passing from I to U is equivalent to solving an exponential size\ninstance of the closest vector in a lattice problem (CVP); and (c) all but a\ndoubly exponentially small fraction of such unitaries have minimal Pauli\ngeodesics of exponential length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2005 23:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
