In\nthe past few years, this problem has been exacerbated by the rise of digital\nimaging, providing vast digital streams of astronomical images and data. In the\nmodern age of increasing bandwidth, human identifications are many times\nimpracticably slow. In order to perform an automatic computer-based analysis of\nastronomical frames, a quick and accurate identification of astronomical\nobjects is required. Such identification must follow a rigorous transformation\nfrom topocentric celestial coordinates into image coordinates on a CCD frame.\nThis paper presents a fuzzy logic based algorithm that estimates needed\ncoordinate transformations in a practical setting. Using a training set of\nreference stars, the algorithm statically builds a fuzzy logic model.

They provide information on the acceleration physics\nindependent of radiative and other losses, which confuse measurements of the\nsynchrotron spectra in most radio, optical and X-ray studies. We find a narrow\nrange of inferred low energy electron energy slopes, n(E)=const*E^-2.1 for the\ncurrently small sample of lower luminosity sources classified as FRI (not\nclassical doubles). This distribution is close to, but apparently inconsistent\nwith, the test particle limit of n(E)=const*E^-2.0 expected from strong\ndiffusive shock acceleration in the non-relativistic limit. Relativistic shocks\nor those modified by the back-pressure of efficiently accelerated cosmic rays\nare two alternatives to produce somewhat steeper spectra. We note for further\nstudy the possiblity of acceleration through shocks, turbulence or shear in the\nflaring/brightening regions in FRI jets as they move away from the nucleus.\nJets on pc scales and the collimated jets and hot spots of FRII (classical\ndouble) sources would be governed by different acceleration sites and\nmechanisms; they appear to show a much wider range of spectra than for FRI\nsources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2005 14:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Since a 2D topological quantum field\ntheory is equivalent to a commutative Frobenius algebra, this result also shows\nthat every 2D TQFT is obtained from an ambijunction in some 2-category.

It is therefore inevitable that virtually all domains of engineering\nand physics need reference oscillators. The oscillator noise can be decomposed\ninto amplitude noise and phase noise. The latter, far more important, affects\ntiming, for it is related to precision and accuracy of measurements.\n  The oscillator, inherently, turns the phase noise of the internal parts into\nfrequency noise. This is a necessary consequence of the Barkhausen condition,\nwhich states that the loop gain must be of one, with zero phase, for stationary\noscillation. There follows that oscillator phase noise, which is the integral\nof the frequency noise, diverges in the long run. This is the Leeson effect.\n  The topics covered can be divided into three parts. Chapter 1 addresses\nlanguage and general physical mechanisms. Chapter 2 aims at understanding the\ninside of commercial oscillators through the analysis of the specifications.\nChapter 3 and 4 focus on the use of the Laplace transform to describe the\noscillator and its phase noise.\n  Since spring 2004, I had the opportunity to give some seminars on noise in\noscillators at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, at the IEEE Frequency Control\nSymposium, at the FEMTO-ST Laboratory, and at the Universite' Henri Poincare'.\nThese seminars had the purpose to provide a TUTORIAL, as opposed to a report on\nadvanced science, addressed to a variety of people including technicians, PhD\nstudents, and senior scientists.

This means that classical singularities are not\nuniversal in the process of non-commutativization.\n  Based on this construction we moreover give a non-commutative version of both\nthe Veronese mapping which is the mapping from $\\fukuso P^{1}$ to $\\fukuso\nP^{n}$ with mapping degree $n$ and the spin representation of the group SU(2).\n  We also present some challenging problems concerning how classical\n(beautiful) properties can be extended to the non-commutative case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2005 00:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2005 06:49:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
