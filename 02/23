Here, we consider the\npossible effects of these powerful explosions on the structure of the accretion\ndisk. The goal is to account for the apparent evolution of the innermost\nregions of the accretion disk around 4U 1820-30 during a superburst. Three\ndifferent processes are considered in detail: radiatively or thermally driven\noutflows, inflow due to Poynting-Robertson drag, and a structural change to the\ndisk by X-ray heating. Radiatively driven winds with large column densities can\nbe launched from the inner disk, but only for L/L_{Edd} >~ 1, which is expected\nto be obtained only at the onset of the burst. Furthermore, the predicted mass\noutflow rate is less than the accretion rate in 4U 1820-30. Estimates of the\nPoynting-Robertson or radiative drag timescale shows that it is a very\nefficient means of removing angular momentum from the gas. However, the\nanalytical results are likely only applicable at the innermost edge of the\ndisk. X-ray heating gives a change in the disk scale height that is correlated\nwith the blackbody temperature, as seen in the evolution during the 4U 1820-30\nsuperburst. If this change in the scale height can alter the surface density,\nthen the viscous time (with \\alpha ~ 0.03-0.2) is the closest match to the 4U\n1820-30 results. We expect, however, that all three processes are likely\nongoing when an accretion disk is subject to a sudden heating event.\nUltimately, a numerical simulation of a disk around a bursting neutron star is\nrequired to determine the exact response of the disk. Magnetic truncation of\nthe accretion flow is also considered and applied to the 4U 1820-30 X-ray\nreflection results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2005 17:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Although not based on the same approach, the recently\npresented nonlinear guiding center (NLGC) theory is recovered as a special\ncase. The approach used here is rather based on the argument that a well\ndefined particle gyromotion does not exist in strong fluctuations than on the\nassumption that the particle gyrocenter follows magnetic field lines which\nthemselves separate diffusively. The assumption of a guiding center motion and\nthe diffusive separation of magnetic field lines is absolutely central to the\nNLGC theory. It is argued that the NLGC result should provide most accurate\nresults for strong fluctuations. Furthermore, as a direct consequence of the\nparticle equation of motion, it is shown that particle diffusion in one\nperpendicular direction is governed by the fluctuations in the other normal\ndirection. This results contradicts the NLGC result, where perpendicular\ndiffusion is triggered by fluctuations in the same direction. This is of\nparticular interest for anisotropic perpendicular diffusion in a\nnon-axisymmetric turbulence.

The possibility that dust in\nthe foreground galaxies could produce the anti-correlation is marginally\nrejected, at the 2sigma level through consideration of QSO colours. It is\npossible that dust that obscures QSOs without reddening them, or preferentially\ndiscards reddened QSOs from the 2QZ sample, could produce such an\nanti-correlation, however, such models are at odds with the positive QSO-galaxy\ncorrelations found at bright magnitudes by other authors.

The research presented here is intended to be a\nstep towards this vision. In previous work (JohnnyVon 1.0), we simulated\nmachines that bonded together to form self-replicating strands. There were two\ntypes of machines (called types 0 and 1), which enabled strands to encode\narbitrary bit strings. However, the information encoded in the strands had no\nfunctional role in the simulation. The information was replicated without being\ninterpreted, which was a significant limitation for potential manufacturing\napplications. In the current work (JohnnyVon 2.0), the information in a strand\nis interpreted as instructions for assembling a polygonal mesh. There are now\nfour types of machines and the information encoded in a strand determines how\nit folds. A strand may be in an unfolded state, in which the bonds are straight\n(although they flex slightly due to virtual forces acting on the machines), or\nin a folded state, in which the bond angles depend on the types of machines. By\nchoosing the sequence of machine types in a strand, the user can specify a\nvariety of polygonal shapes. A simulation typically begins with an initial\nunfolded seed strand in a soup of unbonded machines. The seed strand replicates\nby bonding with free machines in the soup. The child strands fold into the\nencoded polygonal shape, and then the polygons drift together and bond to form\na mesh. We demonstrate that a variety of polygonal meshes can be manufactured\nin the simulation, by simply changing the sequence of machine types in the\nseed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2005 16:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The directional dependence of asymptotic fields near such de\nSitter-like or anti-de Sitter-like I is explicitly found and described. We\ndemonstrate that the corresponding directional structure of radiation has a\nuniversal character that is determined by the algebraic (Petrov) type of the\nfield. In particular, when Lambda>0 the radiation vanishes only along\ndirections which are opposite to principal null directions. For Lambda<0 the\ndirectional dependence is more complicated because it is necessary to\ndistinguish outgoing and ingoing radiation. Near such anti-de Sitter-like\nconformal infinity the corresponding directional structures differ, depending\nnot only on the number and degeneracy of the principal null directions at P but\nalso on their specific orientation with respect to I. The directional structure\nof radiation near (anti-)de Sitter-like infinities supplements the standard\npeeling-off property of spin-s fields. This offers a better understanding of\nthe asymptotic behaviour of the fields near conformal infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2005 16:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

According to\nKolmogorov, isotropy is recovered in the large Reynolds number limit as the\nscale is reduced and, in the so-called inertial range, universal features\n-namely the scaling exponents of structure functions - emerge clearly. However\nthis picture is violated in a number of cases, typically in the high shear\nregion of wall bounded flows. The common opinion ascribes this effect to the\ncontamination of the inertial range by the larger anisotropic scales, i.e. the\nresidual anisotropy is assumed as a weak perturbation of an otherwise isotropic\ndynamics. In this case, given the rotational invariance of the Navier-Stokes\nequations, the isotropic component of the structure functions keeps the same\nexponents of isotropic turbulence. This kind of reasoning fails when the\nanisotropic effects are strong as in the production range of shear dominated\nflows. This regime is analyzed here by means of both numerical and experimental\ndata for a homogeneous shear flow. A well defined scaling behavior is found to\nexist, with exponents which differ substantially from those of classical\nisotropic turbulence. Contrary to what predicted by the perturbation approach,\nsuch a deep alteration concerns the isotropic sector itself. The general\nvalidity of these results is discussed in the context of turbulence near solid\nwalls, where more appropriate closure models for the coarse grained\nNavier-Stokes equations would be advisable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2005 16:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Relation between\nmirror ANCs, if understood properly, can be used to predict astrophysically\nrelevant direct proton capture cross sections using neutron ANCs measured with\nstable beams. In this work, we calculate one-nucleon ANCs for several light\nmirror pairs, using microscopic two-, three- and four-cluster models, and\ncompare the ratio of mirror ANCs to the predictions of the simple analytic\nformula. We also investigate mirror symmetry between other characteristics of\nmirror one-nucleon overlap integrals, namely, spectroscopic factors and\nsingle-particle ANCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2005 11:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-11"}
