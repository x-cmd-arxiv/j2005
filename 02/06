A modified version of the two-slit experiment is proposed in which\nthe moveable detector/counter used to obtain the fringe distribution by\ncounting single photons at different positions on the screen plane is replaced\nwith a mirror positioned at an angle to the screen plane. A single photon\narriving at the mirror through one of the slits is reflected at one of two\nangles along one of two divergent paths.

This modification results in the ability to generate which\nway information based on the path taken by the reflected photon as well as the\ndistribution of photon counts on the screen plane, one for each slit. Since the\nphoton does not experience any change other than the reflection at the mirror\nthe question whether fringes are also present because of a priori interference\neffects when no mirror is present can be answered by examining the two a\nposteriori distributions.
