Hence, some bright\nEUV loops must be preceded by bright X-ray loops. Previous analysis of X-ray\nand EUV active region observations, however, have concluded that EUV loops are\nnot preceded by X-ray loops. In this paper, we examine two active regions\nobserved in both X-ray and EUV filters and analyze the evolution of five loops\nover several hours.

The delay between the appearance of the\nloops in the X-ray and EUV filters is as little as 1 hour and as much as 3\nhours. All five loops appear as single ``monolithic'' structures in the X-ray\nimages, but are resolved into many smaller structures in the (higher\nresolution) EUV images. The positions of the loops appear to shift during\ncooling implying that the magnetic field is changing as the loops evolve. There\nis no correlation between the brightness of the loop in the X-ray and EUV\nfilters meaning a bright X-ray loop does not necessarily cool to a bright EUV\nloop and vice versa.

Neptune Trojans\nresembling the prototype 2001 QR322 (``QR'')--whose radius of ~100 km is\ncomparable to that of the largest Jupiter Trojan--may outnumber their Jovian\ncounterparts by a factor of ~10.

After the formation of the dust layer, small dust grains remain floating\nabove the layer.

In particular, elliptic and K3 fibered\nCalabi-Yau fourfolds are important for dualities between string\ncompactifications with four flat space-time dimensions. A natural framework for\nstudying explicit examples of such fibrations is given by Calabi-Yau\nhypersurfaces in toric varieties, because this class of varieties is\nsufficiently large to provide examples with very different features while still\nallowing a large degree of explicit control. In this paper, many examples for\nelliptic K3 fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds are found (not constructed) by\nsearching for reflexive subpolyhedra of reflexive polyhedra corresponding to\nhypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces. Subpolyhedra not always give rise\nto fibrations and the obstructions are studied. In addition, perturbative gauge\nalgebras for dual heterotic string theories are determined. In order to do so,\nall elliptically fibered toric K3 surfaces are determined. Then, the\ncorresponding gauge algebras are calculated without specialization to\nparticular polyhedra for the elliptic fibers. Finally, the perturbative gauge\nalgebras for the fourfold fibrations are extracted from the generic fibers and\nmonodromy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2005 15:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These operators are the original operator transformed into\nits canonical form and the adjoint of this canonical form. The\ndistinguishability of these operators is quantified by the minimum overlap of\nthe output states over all possible input probe states. The entangling capacity\nof the original unitary operator is therefore directly related to the degree of\nnon-Hermiticity of its canonical form, as quantified in an operationally\nsatisfactory manner in terms of the extent to which it can be distinguished, by\nmeasurement, from its adjoint. Furthermore, the maximum entropy of\nentanglement, again without local ancillas, that a given two-qubit unitary\noperator can generate, is found to be closely related to the classical\ncapacities of certain quantum channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2005 20:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2005 16:34:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 May 2005 21:06:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2005 12:30:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
