Its cornerstone is a smooth free-energy functional, designed so that\nthe stable solutions connecting any two phases are completely free of the third\nphase. For the simplest choice of this functional, the equations of motion for\neach of the two solid-liquid interfaces can be mapped to the standard\nphase-field model of single-phase solidification, and all thin-interface\ncorrections to the dynamics of the solid-liquid interfaces can be eliminated.\nThis means that simulation results become independent of the thickness W of the\ndiffuse interfaces. As a consequence, accurate results can be obtained using\nvalues of W much larger than the physical interface thickness, which makes\nsimulations for realistic experimental parameters feasible. Convergence of the\nsimulation outcome with decreasing W is explicitly demonstrated. The results\nare also compared to a boundary-integral formulation of the corresponding\nfree-boundary problem. Excellent agreement is found, except in the immediate\nvicinity of bifurcation points, where differences arise. These differences\nreveal that, in contrast to the standard assumptions of the free-boundary\nproblem, out of equilibrium the diffuse trijunction region of the phase-field\nmodel can (i) slightly deviate from Young's law for the contact angles, and\n(ii) advance in a direction that forms a finite angle with the solid-solid\ninterface at each instant. While the deviation (i) extrapolates to zero in the\nlimit of vanishing interface thickness, the small angle in (ii) remains roughly\nconstant, which indicates that it might be a genuine physical effect, present\neven for an atomic-scale interface thickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2005 19:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

As noted previously by Bechhoefer and Johnson (Am.\nJ. Phys. 1996), in the case of two equally-spaced impulses per period there are\nonly subharmonic modes of instability. The familiar situation of alternating\nsubharmonic and harmonic resonance tongues emerges for unequally-spaced\nimpulses.

Highly repetitive DNA is particularly rich in\nhomo-- and di--nucleotide repeats, while middle repetitive DNA is rich of\nfamilies of interspersed, mobile elements hundreds of base pairs (bp) long,\namong which the Alu families. A link between homo- and di-polymeric tracts and\nmobile elements has been recently highlighted. In particular, the mobility of\nAlu repeats, which form 10% of the human genome, has been correlated with the\nlength of poly(A) tracts located at one end of the Alu. These tracts have a\nrigid and non-bendable structure and have an inhibitory effect on nucleosomes,\nwhich normally compact the DNA.
