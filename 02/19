This is 3 - 5 times larger than any previously mapped Andromeda\nspheroidal/disk component.

The radio emission is due to\ngyrosynchrotron radiation in a large-scale magnetic field of about 175 G, which\nis maintained on timescales longer than three years. The detected 3-hour period\nmay be due to (i) the orbital motion of a companion at a separation of about\nfive stellar radii, similar to the configuration of RS CVn systems, (ii) an\nequatorial rotation velocity of about 37 km/s and an anchored, long-lived\nmagnetic field, or (iii) periodic release of magnetic stresses in the form of\nweak flares.

Unlike Einstein theory, distributional defects of\nlocally smooth geometry and codimension greater than 2 are demonstrated to\nexist in Lovelock theories. The form of the matching conditions depends on the\nparity of the brane codimension. For odd codimension, the matching conditions\ninvolve discontinuities of Chern-Simons forms and are thus similar to junction\nconditions for hypersurfaces. For even codimension, the bulk Lovelock densities\ninduce intrinsic Lovelock densities on the brane. In particular, this results\nin the appearance of the induced Einstein tensor for p>2. For the matching\nconditions we present, the effect of the bulk is reduced to an overall\ntopological solid angle defect which sets the Planck scale on the brane and to\nextrinsic curvature terms. Moreover, for topological matching conditions and\nconstant solid angle deficit, we find that the equations of motion are obtained\nfrom an exact p+1 dimensional action, which reduces to an induced Lovelock\ntheory for large codimension.
