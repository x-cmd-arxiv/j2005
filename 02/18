We construct a simple geometric model which\nsuccessfully reproduces the eclipse light curves, based on the idea that the\nradio pulses are attenuated by synchrotron absorption on the closed magnetic\nfield lines of pulsar B. The model explains most of the properties of the\neclipse: its asymmetric form, the nearly frequency-independent duration, and\nthe modulation of the brightness of pulsar A at both once and twice the\nrotation frequency of pulsar B in different parts of the eclipse. This detailed\nagreement confirms the dipolar structure of the star's poloidal magnetic field.\nThe model makes clear predictions for the degree of linear polarization of the\ntransmitted radiation.\n  The weak frequency dependence of the eclipse duration implies that the\nabsorbing plasma is relativistic, with a density much larger than the\ncorotation charge density. Such hot, dense plasma can be effectively stored in\nthe outer magnetosphere, where cyclotron cooling is slow. The gradual loss of\nparticles inward through the cooling radius is compensated by an upward flux\ndriven by a fluctuating component of the current, and by the pumping of\nmagnetic helicity on the closed field lines. The trapped particles are heated\nto relativistic energies by the damping of magnetospheric turbulence and, at a\nslower rate, by the absorption of the radio emission of the companion pulsar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2005 20:36:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2005 03:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Once their density falls below a certain\ncritical density (which is comparable with the background density of the\ngalaxy) it is often assumed that their evolution is completed. In fact the\nremnant of such a system forms a distribution of stars which are unbound to\neach other and which move on similar orbits in their host potential. With this\nmotivation we study the evolution of an idealised unbound system and follow its\nexpansion and dissolution in the tidal field of a model galaxy. Initially the\nstars are uniformly distributed (with a density below the critical density)\nwithin an ellipsoidal volume. The system itself travels on a circular orbit\nwithin a galaxy modelled as an isothermal sphere. The initial velocities of the\nstars are chosen by assuming that they move on (three-dimensional) epicycles\nwith guiding centre at the centre of the ellipsoid, though the usual epicyclic\ntheory is altered to account for the self-gravity of the system.

The electrical transport properties of\nthe SAM devices were studied as a function of (i) r-value, (ii) temperatures,\nand (iii) different electrodes, via the conductance and differential\nconductance spectra. The measurements were used to analyze the Me-BDT density\nof states near the electrode Fermi level, and the properties of the interface\nbarriers. We measured the Me-BDT single molecule resistance at low bias and\ngold electrodes to be 6x10^9 Ohm. We also determine the energy difference, D\nbetween the Me-BDT HOMO level and the gold Fermi level to be about 1.8 eV. In\naddition we also found that the temperature dependence of the SAM devices with\nr < 10^-4 is much weaker than that of the pure PT device (or r = 0), showing a\nsmall interface barrier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2005 21:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Here we report these new developments by starting with an introduction\nof the main ingredients of the strong disorder RG method. We describe the basic\nproperties of infinite disorder fixed points, which are realized at critical\npoints, and of strong disorder fixed points, which control the singular\nbehaviors in the Griffiths-phases. We then review in detail applications of the\nRG method to various disordered models, either (i) quantum models, such as\nrandom spin chains, ladders and higher dimensional spin systems, or (ii)\nclassical models, such as diffusion in a random potential, equilibrium at low\ntemperature and coarsening dynamics of classical random spin chains, trap\nmodels, delocalization transition of a random polymer from an interface, driven\nlattice gases and reaction diffusion models in the presence of quenched\ndisorder. For several one-dimensional systems, the Ma-Dasgupta RG rules yields\nvery detailed analytical results, whereas for other, mainly higher dimensional\nproblems, the RG rules have to be implemented numerically. If available, the\nstrong disorder RG results are compared with another, exact or numerical\ncalculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2005 12:03:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2005 09:36:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 May 2005 10:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This allows for an accurate calibration of the chronograph by\nobserving shifts in the location of the instrument response for different\ndistances traveled by the light. Measurement of the corresponding shift which\noccurs when light moves the same distance through air and water then enables an\naccurate determination of the ratio of the photon velocities in these two\nmedia.
