This creates a difficulty in comparing measured electronic and\nspectroscopic properties with calculated ones. Since simplified theoretical\nmodels (effective mass, k.p, parabolic models) do not fully convey the effects\nof shape, size and composition on the electronic and spectroscopic properties,\nwe offer to bridge the gap by providing accurately calculated results as a\nfunction of the dot height and composition. Prominent results are the\nfollowing. (i) Regardless of height and composition, the electron levels form\nshells of nearly degenerate states. In contrast, the hole levels form shells\nonly in flat dots and near the highest hole level (HOMO). (ii) In alloy dots,\nthe electrons' ``s-p'' splitting depends weakly on height, while the ``p-p''\nsplitting depends non-monotonically. In non-alloyed InAs/GaAs dots, both these\nsplittings depend weakly on height. For holes in alloy dots, the ``s-p''\nsplitting decreases with increasing height, whereas the ``p-p'' splitting\nremains nearly unchaged. Shallow, non-alloyed dots have a ``s-p'' splitting of\nnearly the same magnitude, whereas the ``p-p'' splitting is larger. (iii) As\nheight increases, the ``s'' and ``p'' character of the wavefunction of the HOMO\nbecomes mixed, and so does the heavy- and light-hole character. (iv) In alloy\ndots, low-lying hole states are localized inside the dot. Remarkably, in\nnon-alloyed InAs/GaAs dots these states become localized at the interface as\nheight increases.

After imposing consistent radiative\nelectro-weak symmetry breaking (EWSB) the model depends upon one mass parameter\n(say, M). In spite of being so constrained one finds consistency with EWSB\nconditions. We demonstrate that those conditions have two solutions for mu<0,\nand none for mu>0. The parameter tan beta results as a prediction and is\napproximately 3-5 for one solution, and 25-40 for the other, depending upon M\nand the top mass. We examine further constraints on the model coming from b->s\ngamma, the muon g-2, Higgs mass limits and WMAP constraints on dark matter.

The discovery that a large\nnumber of uncorrelated proteins can form, under proper conditions, structurally\nsimilar fibrils has suggested that the underlying mechanism is a general\nfeature of polypeptide chains. In the present work, we address the early events\npreceeding amyloid fibril formation in solutions of zinc--free human insulin\nincubated at low pH and high temperature. Aside from being a easy--to--handle\nmodel for protein fibrillation, subcutaneous aggregation of insulin after\ninjection is a nuisance which affects patients with diabetes. Here, we show by\ntime--lapse atomic force microscopy (AFM) that a steady-state distribution of\nprotein oligomers with an exponential tail is reached within few minutes after\nheating. This metastable phase lasts for few hours until aggregation into\nfibrils suddenly occurs. A theoretical explanation of the oligomer\npre--fibrillar distribution is given in terms of a simple\ncoagulation--evaporation kinetic model, in which concentration plays the role\nof a critical parameter. Due to high resolution and sensitivity of AFM\ntechnique, the observation of a long-lasting latency time should be considered\nan actual feature of the aggregation process, and not simply ascribed to\ninstrumental inefficency. These experimental facts, along with the kinetic\nmodel used, claim for a critical role of thermal concentration fluctuations in\nthe process of fibril nucleation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2005 08:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
