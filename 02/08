The origin of these stars\nremains a puzzle. Recently, Hansen and Milosavljevic (2003, HM) have argued\nthat an Intermediate-Mass Black Hole (IMBH) could have delivered the young\nstars to the immediate vicinity of SgrA*. Here we focus on the final stages of\nthe HM scenario. Namely, we integrate numerically the orbits of stars which are\ninitially bound to the IMBH, but are stripped from it by the tidal field of\nSgrA*. Our numerical algorithm is a symplectic integrator designed specifically\nfor the problem at hand; however, we have checked our results with SYMBA, a\nversion of the widely available SWIFT code. We find that the distribution of\nthe post-inspiral orbital parameters is sensitive to the eccentricity of the\ninspiraling IMBH. If the IMBH is on a circular orbit, then the inclinations of\nnumerically computed orbits relative to the inspiral plane are almost always\nsmaller than 10 degrees, and therefore (a) the simulations are in good\nagreement with the observed motions of stars in a clockwise-moving stellar\ndisc, (b) the simulations never reproduce the orbits of stars outside this\ndisc, which include those in the second thick ring of stars and the randomly\noriented unrelaxed orbits of some of the S-stars. If the IMBH's orbital\neccentricity is e=0.6, then approximately half of the stars end up with orbital\ninclinations below 10 degrees, and another half have inclinations anywhere\nbetween 0 and 180 degrees; this is somewhat closer to what's observed.

However, the mechanism\nresponsible for the deposition of energy into the ISM is still unclear.\nStarting from a model for feedback in galaxy formation with a two-phase medium\n(Monaco 2004a), we propose that the perturbation induced by radiative heating\nfrom a quasar on the ISM triggers a critical change of feedback regime. In the\nfeedback model, SNRs expanding in the hot and pressurized phase of a\nstar-forming spheroid tipically become pressure-confined before the hot\ninterior gas is able to cool. Whenever the evaporation flow due to radiative\nheating of the quasar is significant with respect to the star-formation rate,\nthe SNRs reach the point where their interior gas cools before being confined,\nforming a thick cold shell. We show that in this conditions the shells\npercolate into a super-shell of cold gas that sweeps the whole galaxy.\nRadiation pressure then pushes the shell out of the galaxy. This self-limiting\nmechanism leads to a correlation between black hole and bulge masses. The\ninsertion of a motivated wind trigger criterion in a hierarchical galaxy\nformation model shows however that winds are not necessary to obtain a good\nblack hole--bulge correlation. In absence of winds, good results are obtained\nif the mechanism responsible for the creation of a reservoir of low-angular\nmomentum gas (able to accrete onto the black hole) deposits mass at a rate\nproportional to the star-formation rate.

Our bubbles\nare inflated near the base of the ICM over a finite time interval from a region\nwhose magnetic field is isolated from the ICM. We confirm both the early\nconjecture from linear analysis and the later results based on preformed MHD\nbubbles; namely, that very modest ICM magnetic fields can stabilize the rising\nbubbles against disruption by Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities. We find in addition that amplification of the ambient fields as\nthey stretch around the bubbles can be sufficient to protect the bubbles or\ntheir initial fragments even if the fields are initially much too weak to play\na significant role early in the evolution of the bubbles. Indeed, even with\ninitial fields less than a micro-Gauss and values of $\\beta = P_g/P_b$\napproaching $10^5$, magnetic stresses in our simulations eventually became\nlarge enough to influence the bubble evolution. Magnetic field influence also\ndepends significantly on the geometry of the ICM field and on the topology of\nthe field at the bubble/ICM interface. For example, reconnection of\nanti-parallel fields across the bubble top greatly reduced the ability of the\nmagnetic field to inhibit disruptive instabilities. Our results confirm earlier\nestimates of $10^8$ yr for relic radio bubble lifetimes and show that magnetic\nfields can account for the long term stability of these objects against\ndisruption by surface instabilities.

The\nmaser is pumped as electrons are accelerated by the parallel electric field\nthat develops as a result of the mirror.

Synchrotron absorption, by relativistic electrons within the jet,\npresents the largest obstacle to the escape of the maser radiation, and may\nrender most of it invisible.

This paper illustrates some properties of diffusive acceleration at\nrelativistic shocks that pertain to GRB models, providing interpretation of the\nBATSE/EGRET data. Using a standard Monte Carlo simulation, computations of the\nspectral shape, and the range of spectral indices are presented, as functions\nof the shock speed, magnetic field obliquity and the type of particle\nscattering. It is clear that while quasi-parallel, relativistic shocks with\nfields approximately normal to the shock plane can efficiently accelerate\nparticles, highly oblique and perpendicular ones cannot unless the particle\ndiffusion is almost isotropic, i.e. extremely close to the Bohm limit.\nAccordingly, an array of distribution indices should be present in the burst\npopulation, as is exhibited by the EGRET data, and even mildly-relativistic\ninternal shocks require strong field turbulence in order to model the >100 MeV\nobservations. In addition, recent spectral fitting to burst data in the BATSE\nband is discussed, providing probes of the efficiency of injection of\nnon-thermal electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2005 03:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We\nshow that the effects of shear viscosity as well as a magnetic fields in the\ncluster gas can prevent the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities on relevant\nscale lengths. R-T instabilities on pc-scales are suppressed even if the\nkinematic viscosity of the cluster gas is reduced by two orders of magnitude\ncompared to the value given by Spitzer for a fully ionised, unmagnetised gas.\nSimilarly, magnetic fields exceeding a few microG result in an effective\nsurface tension preventing the disruption of bubbles.

The technique unifies the analysis of both the\nminimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) receiver and the adaptive least-squares (ALS)\nreceiver, and also uses a common approach for both random i.i.d. and random\northogonal precoding. We derive expressions for the asymptotic\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) of the MMSE receiver, and both the\ntransient and steady-state SINR of the ALS receiver, trained using either\ni.i.d. data sequences or orthogonal training sequences. The results are in\nterms of key system parameters, and allow for arbitrary distributions of the\npower of each of the data streams and the eigenvalues of the channel\ncorrelation matrix. In the case of the ALS receiver, we allow a diagonal\nloading constant and an arbitrary data windowing function. For i.i.d. training\nsequences and no diagonal loading, we give a fundamental relationship between\nthe transient/steady-state SINR of the ALS and the MMSE receivers. We\ndemonstrate that for a particular ratio of receive to transmit dimensions and\nwindow shape, all channels which have the same MMSE SINR have an identical\ntransient ALS SINR response. We demonstrate several applications of the\nresults, including an optimization of information throughput with respect to\ntraining sequence length in coded block transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2005 04:31:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2005 07:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

The helix is modeled by\nthree spines of hydrogen-bonded peptide units linked via covalent bonds. To\nremove the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide-I mode and to\nrenormalized the vibron-phonon coupling, two unitary transformation have been\napplied to reach the dressed anharmonic vibron point of view. It is shown that\nthe vibron dynamics results from the competition between inter-spine and\nintra-spine vibron hops and that the two kinds of hopping processes do not\nexperience the same dressing mechanism. Therefore, at low temperature (or weak\nvibron-phonon coupling), the polaron behaves as an undressed vibron delocalized\nover all the spines whereas at biological temperature (or strong vibron-phonon\ncoupling), the dressing effect strongly reduces the vibrational exchanges\nbetween different spines. As a result the polaron propagates along a single\nspine as in the 1D Davydov model. Although the helix supports both acoustical\nand optical phonons, this feature originates in the coupling between the vibron\nand the acoustical phonons, only.
