We investigate the interplay between\nsupersonic turbulence and magnetic fields using numerical simulations, in a\nsheet-like geometry. We demonstrate that star formation with an efficiency of a\nfew percent can occur over several gravitational collapse times in moderately\nmagnetically subcritical clouds that are supersonically turbulent. The\nturbulence accelerates star formation by reducing the time for dense core\nformation. The dense cores produced are predominantly quiescent, with subsonic\ninternal motions.

In turbulent clouds that are marginally magnetically supercritical,\nthe star formation efficiency is higher, but can still be consistent with the\nvalues inferred for nearby embedded clusters. If not regulated by magnetic\nfields at all, star formation in a multi-Jeans mass cloud endowed with a strong\ninitial turbulence proceeds rapidly, with the majority of cloud mass converted\ninto stars in a gravitational collapse time.

This plays an important role in the attempted classification,\nand in fact we define a system as regular if such deviations are bounded and\nirregular otherwise.

Additionally, they are spark- protected and can operate without\nany feedback problems at high gains, close to a streamer mode. In attempts to\nextend the sensitivity of RPCs to longer wavelengths we have successfully\ntested the operation of the first sealed parallel-plate gaseous detectors with\nCsTe photocathodes.

Here I argue that networks provide a coherent framework\nto construct coarse-grained models for many different physical systems. To\nelucidate these ideas, I discuss two long-standing problems. The first concerns\nthe structure and dynamics of magnetic fields in the solar corona, as\nexemplified by sunspots that startled Galileo almost 400 years ago. We\ndiscovered that the magnetic structure of the corona embodies a scale free\nnetwork, with spots at all scales. A network model representing the\nthree-dimensional geometry of magnetic fields, where links rewire and nodes\nmerge when they collide in space, gives quantitative agreement with available\ndata, and suggests new measurements. Seismicity is addressed in terms of\nrelations between events without imposing space-time windows. A metric\nestimates the correlation between any two earthquakes. Linking strongly\ncorrelated pairs, and ignoring pairs with weak correlation organizes the\nspatio-temporal process into a sparse, directed, weighted network. New scaling\nlaws for seismicity are found. For instance, the aftershock decay rate\ndecreases as 1/t in time up to a correlation time, t[omori]. An estimate from\nthe data gives t[omori] to be about one year for small magnitude 3 earthquakes,\nabout 1400 years for the Landers event, and roughly 26,000 years for the\nearthquake causing the 2004 Asian tsunami. Our results confirm Kagan's\nconjecture that aftershocks can rumble on for centuries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2005 15:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Epidemiological records of\nthe age at which each patient in a population develops carcinoma are known as\nage-incidence data; these provide a quantitative measure of human tumor\ninitiation and dynamics. If crisis brought on by telomere shortening is\nnecessary for most human carcinomas, it may also be the rate limiting step. To\ntest this, we compared a mathematical model in which telomere loss is the rate\nlimiting step during carcinogenesis with age-incidence data compiled by the\nSurveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. We found that this\nmodel adequately explains the age-incidence data. The model also implies that\ntwo distinct paths exist for carcinoma to develop in prostate, breast, and\novary tissues. We conclude that a single step, crisis brought on by telomere\nshortening, limits the rate of formation of human carcinomas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2005 20:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Quantitative relations concerning the\nreleased pulse and the coherences are given. A general situation when the two\ncontrol fields are not proportional at the pulse release stage is also\nexamined.
