We prove that the set of all interval size functions whose underlying\np-orders are polynomial-time decidable is exactly #P. We show that the interval\nsize functions for orders with polynomial-time adjacency checks are closely\nrelated to the class FPSPACE(poly). Indeed, FPSPACE(poly) is exactly the class\nof all nonnegative functions that are an interval size function minus a\npolynomial-time computable function.\n  We study two important functions in relation to interval size functions. The\nfunction #DIV maps each natural number n to the number of nontrivial divisors\nof n. We show that #DIV is an interval size function of a polynomial-time\ndecidable partial p-order with polynomial-time adjacency checks. The function\n#MONSAT maps each monotone boolean formula F to the number of satisfying\nassignments of F. We show that #MONSAT is an interval size function of a\npolynomial-time decidable total p-order with polynomial-time adjacency checks.\n  Finally, we explore the related notion of cluster computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2005 15:24:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2005 15:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}
