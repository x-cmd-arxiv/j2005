This plasma expanded under its own\npressure producing a fireball and the observed gamma-rays escaped once the\nfireball became optically thin. The giant flare was followed by a bright radio\nafterglow, with an observable extended size, implying an energetic relativistic\noutflow. We revisit here the evolution of relativistic fireballs and we\ncalculate the Lorentz factor and energy remaining in relativistic outflow once\nthe radiation escapes. We show that pairs that arise naturally in a pure\npairs-radiation fireball do not carry enough energy to account for the observed\nafterglow. We consider various alternatives and we show that if the\nrelativistic outflow that causes the afterglow is related directly to the\nprompt flare, then the initial fireball must be loaded by baryons or Poynting\nflux. While we focus on parameters applicable to the giant flare and the radio\nafterglow of SGR 1806$-$20 the calculations presented here might be also\napplicable to GRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2005 20:44:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 May 2005 23:44:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2006 01:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The CH3CN (12-11) emission of the toroids in G31.41+0.31\nand core A1 in G24.78+0.08 has been modeled assuming that it arises from a\ndisk-like structure seen edge-on, with a radial velocity field.

Unlike the rotating disks detected around less luminous stars,\nthese toroids are not undergoing Keplerian rotation. From the modeling itself,\nhowever, it is not possible to distinguish between constant rotation or\nconstant angular velocity, since both velocity fields suitably fit the data.\nThe best fit models have been computed adopting a temperature gradient of the\ntype T proportional R^{-3/4}, with a temperature at the outer radius T_out~100\nK for both cores.

If these lines arise from\nphoto-ionization by massive stars in HII regions these results imply that\nmassive, metal rich galaxies exist at high redshift. Here we investigate the\nionization mechanism in a galaxy with Ks=19.1 and z=2.225 in the Chandra Deep\nField South, using the new Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS). GNIRS'\ncross-dispersed mode gives simultaneous access to the entire 1-2.5 micron\nwavelength range, allowing accurate measurements of line ratios of distant\ngalaxies. From the ratio of Halpha/Hbeta we infer that the line emitting gas is\nheavily obscured, with E(B-V)=0.8. The reddening is higher than that inferred\npreviously from the UV-optical continuum emission, consistent with findings for\nnearby star burst galaxies. We find that the galaxy has Seyfert-like line\nratios, [NII]/Halpha ~ 0.6 and [OIII]/Hbeta ~ 6, which can be caused by\nphoto-ionization by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or shock ionization due to\na strong galactic wind. Although we cannot exclude the presence of an AGN, the\nlack of AGN spectral features in the rest-frame ultraviolet, the consistency of\nradio, X-ray, and rest-frame UV star formation indicators, the fact that the\n[OIII]/Hbeta ratio remains high out to ~10 kpc from the nucleus, and the\nobserved gas kinematics all argue for the wind hypothesis. Similar\nshock-induced ionization is seen in nearby star burst galaxies with strong\nwinds. The evidence for shock ionization implies that measurements of\nmetallicities and dynamical masses of star forming z>2 galaxies should be\nregarded with caution, especially since the existence of strong galactic winds\nin these objects is well established.

The\nscheme is based on the cluster expansion and the time dependent perturbation\ntheory implemented numerically. This approach offers a dramatic advantage in\nnumerical efficiency, and it is also more convenient than the commonly used\nMagnus expansion, especially when dealing with higher order terms. We\nillustrate the scheme by designing 2nd-order pi-pulses and a 6th-order 8-pulse\nrefocusing sequence for a chain of qubits with nearest-neighbor couplings. We\nalso discuss the performance of soft-pulse refocusing sequences in suppressing\ndecoherence due to low-frequency environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2005 19:43:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2005 21:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
