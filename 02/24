Using Keck-DEIMOS spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the\n2x1.5 arcmin region surrounding RX J1053.7+5735, we secured redshifts for six\ngalaxies in the range 1.129 < z < 1.139, with a mean redshift <z>=1.134. The\nmean redshift agrees well with the cluster X-ray redshift previously estimated\nfrom the cluster X-ray Fe-K line, confirming the presence of a cluster at\nz~1.135. Galaxies with concordant redshifts are located in both eastern and\nwestern sub-clusters of the double cluster structure, indicating that both\nsub-clusters are at similar redshifts. This result is also consistent with a\nprevious claim that both eastern and western X-ray lobes have similar X-ray\nredshifts. Based on their separation of ~ 250 kpc/h, these results support the\ninterpretation that RX J1053.7+5735 is an equal-mass cluster merger taken place\nat z ~ 1, although further direct evidence for dynamical state of the cluster\nis needed for a more definitive statement about the cluster merging state. The\nsix galaxies have a line-of-sight velocity dispersion = 650 km/s. All six\ngalaxies show clear absorption features of CaII H & K, and several Balmer\nlines, typical of early galaxies at the present epoch, in agreement with their\nI-K colors.

In\nfact, we show that subsamples of the subhalo population with a\ncentrally-concentrated radial distribution, similar to that of the MW dwarfs,\ntypically exhibit a comparable degree of planarity. We explore the origin of\nthe observed subhalo anisotropy and conclude that it is likely due to (1)\npreferential accretion of subhalos along filaments, often closely aligned with\nthe major axis of the host halo, and (2) evolution of satellite orbits within\nthe prolate, triaxial potentials typical of CDM halos. Agreement between\npredictions and observations requires the major axis of the outer dark matter\nhalo of the Milky Way to be nearly perpendicular to the disk. We discuss\npossible observational tests of such disk-halo alignment with current large\ngalaxy surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2005 14:53:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2005 23:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Using the ''volume\nintegral quantifier'' we verify that it is theoretically possible to construct\nthese geometries with vanishing amounts of averaged null energy condition\nviolating phantom energy. Specific wormhole dimensions and the traversal\nvelocity and time are also deduced from the traversability conditions for a\nparticular wormhole geometry. These phantom energy traversable wormholes have\nfar-reaching physical and cosmological implications.

Those expressions are evaluated explicitly for\nseveral special cases and approximations which are generally useful in\nastrophysical and cosmological settings. Besides studying the photon dispersion\nrelations, we consider the macroscopic electrodynamic equations for this\nsystem, which involve the standard dielectric and permeability constants plus\ntwo additional ones related to the photon self-energy functions.

The method thus yields a\n``cartographic representation'' of complex networks. Metabolic networks are\namong the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with\nmore potential for immediate applicability. We use our method to analyze the\nmetabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different super-kingdoms.

The operators that form the bases of the Weyl representation and its\nFourier transform, the chord representation, are, respectively, unitary\nreflection and translation operators. Thus, the general semiclassical study of\nunitary operators allows us to propagate arbitrary operators, including density\noperators, i.e. the Wigner function. The various propagation kernels are\ndifferent representations of the superoperators which act on the space of\noperators of a closed quantum system. We here present the mixed semiclassical\npropagator, that takes translation chords to reflection centres, or vice versa.\nIn contrast to the centre-centre propagator that directly evolves Wigner\nfunctions, it is guaranteed to be caustic free, having a simple WKB-like\nuniversal form for a finite time, whatever the number of degrees of freedom.\nSpecial attention is given to the near-classical region of small chords, since\nthis dominates the averages of observables evaluated through the Wigner\nfunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2005 19:18:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These molecules have both rotational and\nvibrational degrees of freedom. This leads one to ask whether these internal\nmotions can play a role in degrading the interference pattern. We study this by\nmeans of a simple model. Our molecule consists of two masses a fixed distance\napart. It scatters from a potential with two or several peaks, thereby\nmimicking two or several slit interference. We find that in some parameter\nregimes the entanglement between the internal states and the translational\ndegrees of freedom produced by the potential can decrease the visibility of the\ninterference pattern. In particular, different internal states correspond to\ndifferent outgoing wave vectors, so that if several internal states are\nexcited, the total interference pattern will be the sum of a number of\npatterns, each with a different periodicity. The overall pattern is\nconsequently smeared out. In the case of two different peaks, the scattering\nfrom the different peaks will excite different internal states so that the path\nthe molecule takes become entangled with its internal state. This will also\nlead to degradation of the interference pattern.
