The high state spectra are dominated by the continuum and\nindependent of orbital phase whereas the low state spectra show a strong\norbital dependence as well as line emission from O, Ne, Mg, Fe, and Si.

In\nspite of much suggestive evidence this analogy is hardly ever quantified in\nuseful ways. The standard benefit of modeling epidemics is the ability to\nestimate quantitatively population average parameters, such as interpersonal\ncontact rates, incubation times, duration of infectious periods, etc. In most\ncases such quantities generalize naturally to the spread of ideas and provide a\nsimple means of quantifying sociological and behavioral patterns. Here we apply\nseveral paradigmatic models of epidemics to empirical data on the advent and\nspread of Feynman diagrams through the theoretical physics communities of the\nUSA, Japan, and the USSR in the period immediately after World War II. This\ntest case has the advantage of having been studied historically in great\ndetail, which allows validation of our results. We estimate the effectiveness\nof adoption of the idea in the three communities and find values for parameters\nreflecting both intentional social organization and long lifetimes for the\nidea. These features are probably general characteristics of the spread of\nideas, but not of common epidemics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2005 19:54:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 May 2005 15:28:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2005 21:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

This theory has been proposed in\nour previous works. In our previous studies, the energy gradient theory was\ndemonstrated to be applicable for wall-bounded parallel flows. It was found\nthat the critical value of the energy gradient parameter Kmax at turbulent\ntransition is about 370-389 for wall-bounded parallel flows (which include\nplane Poiseuille flow, pipe Poiseuille flow and plane Couette flow) below which\nno turbulence occurs. In this paper, the detailed derivation for the\ncalculation of the energy gradient parameter in the flow between concentric\nrotating cylinders is provided. The calculated results for the critical\ncondition of primary instability (with semi-empirical treatment) are found to\nbe in very good agreement with the experiments in the literature. A possible\nmechanism of spiral turbulence generation observed for counter-rotation of two\ncylinders can also be explained using the energy gradient theory. The energy\ngradient theory can serve to relate the condition of transition in\nTaylor-Couette flow to that in plane Couette flow. The latter reasonably\nbecomes the limiting case of the former when the radii of cylinders tend to\ninfinity. It is our contention that the energy gradient theory is possibly\nfairly universal for analysis of flow instability and turbulent transition, and\nis found valid for both pressure and shear driven flows in parallel and\nrotating flow configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2005 14:07:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2005 10:36:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2007 09:03:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 14:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-13"}
