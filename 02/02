Each pair of particles is thermostated either (with\nprobability P) with a pairwise Lowe-Andersen thermostat, or (with probability\n1-P) with a thermostat that is introduced here, which is based on a pairwise\ninteraction similar to the Nose-Hoover thermostat. When the pairwise\nNose-Hoover thermostat dominates (low P), the liquid has a high diffusion\ncoefficient and low viscosity, but when the Lowe-Andersen thermostat dominates,\nthe diffusion coefficient is low and viscosity is high. This novel\nNose-Hoover-Lowe-Andersen thermostat is Galilean invariant and preserves both\ntotal linear and angular momentum of the system, due to the fact that the\nthermostatic forces between each pair of the particles are pairwise additive\nand central. We show by simulation that this thermostat also preserves\nhydrodynamics. For the (non-interacting) ideal gas at P=0, the diffusion\ncoefficient diverges and viscosity is zero, while for P>0 it has a finite\nvalue. By adjusting probability P, the Schmidt number can be varied by orders\nof magnitude. The temperature deviation from the required value is at least an\norder of magnitude smaller than in Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), while\nthe equilibrium properties of the system are very well reproduced.

Several approaches to the\nstatistical treatment of charm hadronization are considered. The grand\ncanonical approach is appropriate for systems containing large number of charm\n(anti)quarks. The exact charm conservation and Poissonian fluctuations of the\nnumber of charm quark-antiquark pairs should be taken into account, if the\naverage number of these pairs is of oder of unity or smaller. The charm\nhadronization in a subsystem of a larger system is discussed. It is explained\nwhy the canonical approach is not appropriate for the description of charm\nhadronization. The obtained formulas can be used to calculate the production of\ncharm in heavy ion collisions in a wide energy range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2005 17:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To\nunderstand the characteristics of this network intuitively, we visualize it as\na directed graph and an adjacency matrix. Especially detailed features of\nnetworks concerned with the automobile industry sector are discussed by using\nthe visualized networks. The shareholding network is also considered as an\nundirected graph, because many quantities characterizing networks are defined\nfor undirected cases. For this undirected shareholding network, we show that a\ndegree distribution is well fitted by a power law function with an exponential\ntail. The exponent in the power law range is gamma=1.8. We also show that the\nspectrum of this network follows asymptotically the power law distribution with\nthe exponent delta=2.6. By comparison with gamma and delta, we find a scaling\nrelation delta=2gamma-1. The reason why this relation holds is attributed to\nthe local tree-like structure of networks. To clarify this structure, the\ncorrelation between degrees and clustering coefficients is considered. We show\nthat this correlation is negative and fitted by the power law function with the\nexponent alpha=1.1. This guarantees the local tree-like structure of the\nnetwork and suggests the existence of a hierarchical structure.
