Through a study of dynamics\nof the collinear H+H2 reaction and the transmission over simple one-dimensional\nbarrier potentials, we show that decoherence leads to improved agreement\nbetween quantum and classical reaction and transmission probabilities,\nprimarily by increasing the energy dispersion in a well defined way. Increased\npotential nonlinearity is seen to require larger decoherence in order to attain\ncomparable quantum-classical agreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2005 19:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The\nentanglement criterion and the entanglement of formation are directly evaluated\nas a function of these coefficients, without the need for deriving local\nunitary transformations. These reproduce the results of other methods for the\nspecial case of symmetric pure states which employ a relation between squeezed\nstates and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations. The modification of the\nquadrature coefficients and the corresponding entanglement due to application\nof various optical elements is also derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2005 20:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
