The locus of the red giant branches give\nreliable metallicity determinations which compare generally very well with\nground-based integrated spectroscopic and photometric measures, as well as\ngiving good reddening estimates. 2. The HB morphologies show the same behavior\nwith metallicity as the Galactic GCs, with indications that the 2nd-parameter\neffect can be present in some GCs of our sample.

We explore the effects of spatial\ninhomogeneity in the deposition-evaporation ratio by simulations, entropy-based\narguments and a study of the new terms introduced in the free energy. The\nprimary effect is that needles tend to align along the local spatial gradient\nof the ratio. A uniform gradient thus induces a uniformly aligned state, as\ndoes a gradient which varies randomly in magnitude and sign, but acts only in\none direction. Random variations of deposition-evaporation rates in both\ndirections induce frustration, resulting in a state with glassy\ncharacteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2005 09:34:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2005 11:27:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2005 13:07:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here we\nderive analytical expressions which relate the values of key statistics,\nnotably determinism and entropy of line length distribution, to the correlation\nsum as a function of embedding dimension. These expressions are obtained by\nderiving the transformation which generates an embedded recurrence plot from an\nunembedded plot. A single unembedded recurrence plot thus provides the\nstatistics of all possible embedded recurrence plots. If the correlation sum\nscales exponentially with embedding dimension, we show that these statistics\nare determined entirely by the exponent of the exponential. This explains the\nresults of Iwanski and Bradley (Chaos 8 [1998] 861-871) who found that certain\nrecurrence plot statistics are apparently invariant to embedding dimension for\ncertain low-dimensional systems. We also examine the relationship between the\nmutual information content of two timeseries and the common recurrent structure\nseen in their recurrence plots.
