This is due largely to the small sample of\n\\~20 GRBs with the required measured redshifts, jet-breaks, and peak energies,\nand to the strong sensitivity of the goodness-of-fit of the power-law to input\nassumptions. The most important such finding concerns the sensitivity to the\ngenerally unknown density (and density profile), of the circumburst medium.\nAlthough the E_p-E_gamma relation is a highly significant correlation over many\ncosmologies, until the sample expands to include many low-z events, it will be\nmost sensitive to Omega_M but essentially insensitive to Omega_Lambda and w,\nwith some hope of constraining dw/dt with high-z GRB data alone. The relation\nclearly represents a significant improvement in the search for an empirical GRB\nstandard candle, but is further hindered by an unknown physical basis for the\nrelation, the lack of a low-z training set to calibrate the relation in a\ncosmology-independent way, and several major potential systematic uncertainties\nand selection effects. Until these concerns are addressed, a larger sample is\nacquired, and attempts are made to marginalize or perform Monte Carlo\nsimulations over the unknown density distribution, we urge caution concerning\nclaims of the utility of GRBs for cosmography and especially the attempts to\ncombine GRBs with SNe Ia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2005 00:08:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2005 21:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-11"}
