The indices are found to be highly\nsensitive to age variation, with only moderate response to metallicity. For\ngalaxies uncontaminated by nebular emission, our HaA index is more powerful in\nbreaking the age/metallicity degeneracy than H-beta or H-gamma_F. Using a\nsample of red cluster galaxies carefully selected to exclude objects with\nemission, we find a steep decline of HaA with velocity dispersion (slope -0.75\n+/- 0.07 Angstrom/dex). The slope can be translated to constraints on age and\nmetallicity scaling relations, incorporating measurement and model errors. If\nthe HaA-sigma slope is due only to age, we obtain Age proportional to\nsigma^{0.95 +/- 0.12}. Because HaA depends quite weakly on [Fe/H], a\nmetallicity interpretation would require Fe/H proportional to sigma^1.2 or\nsteeper. The HaA-sigma slope is consistent with the combined age and\nmetallicity scaling relations reported by Nelan et al. from classical Lick\nindices.

An\nimbalance between inner and outer torques causes bodies of mass $\\ga 0.1$ Earth\nmasses to lose angular momentum and migrate inward rapidly relative to the\ndisk; this is known as ``Type I'' migration. However, protoplanets that grow to\ngas giant mass, O($10^2) M_\\oplus$, open a gap in the disk and are subsequently\nconstrained to migrate more slowly, locked into the disk's viscous evolution in\nwhat is called \"Type II\" migration. In a young planetary system, both Type I\nand Type II bodies likely coexist; if so, differential migration ought to\nresult in close encounters when the former originate on orbits exterior to the\nlatter. We investigate the resulting dynamics, using two different numerical\napproaches: an N-body code with dissipative forces added to simulate the effect\nof the gas disk, and a hybrid code which combines an N-body component with a\n1-dimensional viscous disk model, treating planet-disk interactions in a more\nself-consistent manner.

We analyze in this paper the biases caused by instrumental and\nturbulent effects to $V^2$ estimators for both narrow and wide band cases.\nVisibilities are estimated from samples of the interferogram using two\ndifferent estimators, $V^{2}_1$ which is the classical sum of the squared\nmodulus of Fourier components and a new estimator $V^{2}_2$ for which complex\nFourier components are summed prior to taking the square. We present an\napproach for systematically evaluating the performance and limits of each\nestimator, and to optimizing observing parameters for each. We include the\neffects of spectral bandwidth, chromatic dispersion, scan length, and\ndifferential piston. We also establish the expression of the Signal-to-Noise\nRatio of the two estimators with respect to detector and photon noise. The\n$V^{2}_1$ estimator is insensitive to dispersion and is always more sensitive\nthan the $V^{2}_2$ estimator. However, the latter allows to reach better\naccuracies when detection is differential piston noise limited. Biases and\nnoise directly impact the dynamic range of reconstructed images. Very high\ndynamic ranges are required for direct exoplanet detection by interferometric\ntechniques thus requiring estimators to be bias-free or biases to be accurately\ncalibrated.

A series of crystals with\ndifferent superconducting transition temperatures ($T_c$) ranging from 2.5 K to\n4.4 K were obtained.
