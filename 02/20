We investigate analytically\nthe time response of a thin accretion disc to particular axisymmetric\nperturbations. To facilitate an analytical treatment we replace the energy\nequation with a general polytropic assumption. The asymptotic expansion of\nKlu\\'zniak & Kita (2000), which extended the method of Regev (1983) to a full\nsteady polytropic disc (with $n=3/2$), is further developed and implemented for\nboth the steady (for any polytropic index) and time-dependent problems. The\nspatial form and temporal behaviour of selected dynamical disturbances are\nstudied in detail. We identify the perturbation space which leads to transient\ngrowth and provide analytical solutions which manifest this expected transient\ngrowth behaviour. Three terms (physical causes) responsible for the appearance\nof transient growth are identified. Two depend explicitly on the viscosity\nwhile the third one is relevant also for inviscid discs. The main conclusion we\ndraw is that the phenomenon of transient growth exists in discs on a global\nscale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2005 09:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This assumption allows implementation of fast algorithms for\npairwise sequence alignment, but it ignores information that could conceivably\nincrease the power of remote homolog detection. We examine the validity of this\nassumption by constructing extended substitution matrixes that encapsulate the\nobserved correlations between neighboring sites, by developing an efficient and\nrigorous algorithm for pairwise protein sequence alignment that incorporates\nthese local substitution correlations, and by assessing the ability of this\nalgorithm to detect remote homologies. Results: Our analysis indicates that\nlocal correlations between substitutions are not strong on the average.\nFurthermore, incorporating local substitution correlations into pairwise\nalignment did not lead to a statistically significant improvement in remote\nhomology detection. Therefore, the standard assumption that individual residues\nwithin protein sequences evolve independently of neighboring positions appears\nto be an efficient and appropriate approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2005 23:19:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2005 21:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}
