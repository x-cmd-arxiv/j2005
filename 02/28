It has been shown that within a nonlocal chiral\nquark model the critical density for a phase transition to color\nsuperconducting quark matter under neutron star conditions can be low enough\nfor these phases to occur in compact star configurations with masses below 1.3\nM_sun. For a realistic choice of parameters the equation of state (EoS) allows\nfor 2SC quark matter with a large quark gap ~ 100 MeV for u and d quarks of two\ncolors that coexists with normal quark matter within a mixed phase in the\nhybrid star interior. We argue that, if in the hadronic phase the neutron\npairing gap in 3P_2 channel is larger than few keV and the phases with unpaired\nquarks are allowed, the corresponding hybrid stars would cool too fast.\n  Even in the case of the essentially suppressed 3P_2 neutron gap if free\nquarks occur for M < 1.3 M_sun, as it follows from our EoS, one could not\nappropriately describe the neutron star cooling data existing by today.\n  It is suggested to discuss a \"2SC+X\" phase, as a possibility to have all\nquarks paired in two-flavor quark matter under neutron star constraints, where\nthe X-gap is of the order of 10 keV - 1 MeV. Density independent gaps do not\nallow to fit the cooling data. Only the presence of an X-gap that decreases\nwith increase of the density could allow to appropriately fit the data in a\nsimilar compact star mass interval to that following from a purely hadronic\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2005 15:46:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The\nVirtual Haken Conjecture posits that every irreducible 3-manifold with infinite\nfundamental group has a finite cover which is Haken. In this paper, we study\nrandom 3-manifolds and their finite covers in an attempt to shed light on this\ndifficult question. In particular, we consider random Heegaard splittings by\ngluing two handlebodies by the result of a random walk in the mapping class\ngroup of a surface. For this model of random 3-manifold, we are able to compute\nthe probabilities that the resulting manifolds have finite covers of particular\nkinds. Our results contrast with the analogous probabilities for groups coming\nfrom random balanced presentations, giving quantitative theorems to the effect\nthat 3-manifold groups have many more finite quotients than random groups. The\nnext natural question is whether these covers have positive betti number. For\nabelian covers of a fixed type over 3-manifolds of Heegaard genus 2, we show\nthat the probability of positive betti number is 0.\n  In fact, many of these questions boil down to questions about the mapping\nclass group. We are lead to consider the action of mapping class group of a\nsurface S on the set of quotients pi_1(S) -> Q. If Q is a simple group, we show\nthat if the genus of S is large, then this action is very mixing. In\nparticular, the action factors through the alternating group of each orbit.\nThis is analogous to Goldman's theorem that the action of the mapping class\ngroup on the SU(2) character variety is ergodic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2005 19:49:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2005 23:18:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2007 18:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
