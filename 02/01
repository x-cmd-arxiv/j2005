The achieved baseline\nrms of about 50 mK at the original 2.6 km/s velocity resolution allows us to\nsearch for evidence of ram-pressure interaction with the ambient medium.

The pressure of the ambient medium might\nalso stabilise CHVCs in addition to their own gravitational potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2005 10:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

To this end,\nwe investigate the electronic properties of water at ambient conditions using\nab initio density functional theory within the generalized gradient\napproximation (DFT/GGA), focussing on the unoccupied subspace of Kohn-Sham\neigenstates. We generate long (250 ps) classical trajectories for large\nsupercells, up to 256 molecules, from which uncorrelated configurations of\nwater molecules are extracted for use in DFT/GGA calculations of the electronic\nstructure. We find that the density of occupied states of this molecular liquid\nis well described with 32 molecule supercells using a single k-point (k = 0) to\napproximate integration over the first Brillouin zone. However, the description\nof the density of unoccupied states (u-EDOS) is sensitive to finite size\neffects. Small, 32 molecule supercell calculations, using Gamma-the point\napproximation, yield a spuriously isolated state above the Fermi level.\nNevertheless, the more accurate u-EDOS of large, 256 molecule supercells may be\nreproduced using smaller supercells and increased k-point sampling. This\nindicates that the electronic structure of molecular liquids like water is\nrelatively insensitive to the long-range disorder in the molecular structure.\nThese results have important implications for efficiently increasing the\naccuracy of spectral calculations for water and other molecular liquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2005 22:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

The qualitative features of this system\n(generalized Blume-Capel spin model) are shown to resemble a large class of\ninverse melting phenomena.

However, it is assumed to be only a\nlow-energy effective theory which will break down at higher energy scales,\ntheoretically motivated to be around 1 TeV. There are a variety of proposed\nmodels of new physics beyond the Standard Model, most notably supersymmetric\nand extra dimension models. New charged and neutral heavy leptons are a feature\nof a number of theories of new physics, including the `intermediate scale'\nclass of supersymmetric models. Using a time-of-flight technique to detect the\ncharged leptons at the Large Hadron Collider, the discovery range (in the\nparticular scenario studied in the first part of this thesis) is found to\nextend up to masses of 950 GeV. Extra dimension models, particularly those with\nlarge extra dimensions, allow the possible experimental production of black\nholes. The remainder of the thesis describes some theoretical results and\ncomputational tools necessary to model the production and decay of these\nminiature black holes at future particle colliders. The grey-body factors which\ndescribe the Hawking radiation emitted by higher-dimensional black holes are\ncalculated numerically for the first time and then incorporated in a Monte\nCarlo black hole event generator; this can be used to model black hole\nproduction and decay at next-generation colliders. It is hoped that this\ngenerator will allow more detailed examination of black hole signatures and\nhelp to devise a method for extracting the number of extra dimensions present\nin nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2005 11:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We observe that this advantage is\nlost in models based on string compactifications whose volume is stabilized by\na nonperturbative superpotential: the F-term energy associated with volume\nstabilization causes the eta problem to reappear.

The investigation of massive models covers\nrecent work on superspin-3/2 and superspin-1 multiplets. Superspin-3/2\nmultiplets contain component fields with spins (2, 3/2, 3/2, 1) and superspin-1\nmultiplets contain component fields with spins (3/2, 1, 1, 1/2).

The first is based on joint work with Verch, and draws\nconnections between microscopic stability (microlocal spectrum condition),\nmesoscopic stability (QEIs) and macroscopic stability (passivity). The second\ndirection considers QEIs for a countable number of massive scalar fields, and\nlinks the existence and scaling properties of QEIs to the spectrum of masses.\nThe upshot is that the existence of a suitable QEI with polynomial scaling is a\nsufficient condition for the model to satisfy the Buchholz--Wichmann nuclearity\ncriterion. We briefly discuss on-going work with Ojima and Porrmann which seeks\nto gain a deeper understanding of this relationship.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2005 10:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In coordinates $\\{q^i,p_k\\}$ the\ncanonical symplectic two-form is $\\omega_0=dq^i\\wedge dp_i$. It is well known\nin symplectic mechanics {\\bf\\cite{Souriau,Abraham,Guillemin}} that the\ninteraction of a charged particle with a magnetic field can be described in a\nHamiltonian formalism without a choice of a potential. This is done by means of\na modified symplectic two-form $\\omega=\\omega_0-e\\F$, where $e$ is the charge\nand the (time-independent) magnetic field $\\F$ is closed: $\\dif\\F=0$. With this\nsymplectic structure, the canonical momentum variables acquire non-vanishing\nPoisson brackets: $\\{p_k,p_l\\} = e F_{kl}(q)$. Similarly a closed two-form in\n$p$-space $\\G$ may be introduced. Such a {\\it dual magnetic field} $\\G$\ninteracts with the particle's {\\it dual charge} $r$. A new modified symplectic\ntwo-form $\\omega=\\omega_0-e\\F+r\\G$ is then defined. Now, both $p$- and\n$q$-variables will cease to Poisson commute and upon quantisation they become\nnoncommuting operators. In the particular case of a linear phase space ${\\bf\nR}^{2N}$, it makes sense to consider constant $\\F$ and $\\G$ fields. It is then\npossible to define, by a linear transformation, global Darboux coordinates:\n$\\{\\xi^i,\\pi_k\\}= {\\delta^i}_k$.

Such condition can be considered as a generalisation of the\nf-Leibniz conditions introduced by Kerr and Li.

Similar optical effects are observed upon removing oxygen from WO_3,\nalthough the electronic properties are slightly different. Here we present a\ncomputational study of cubic and hexagonal alkali bronzes and examine the\neffects on cell size and band structure as the size of the intercalated ion is\nincreased. With the exception of hydrogen (which is predicted to be unstable as\nan intercalate), the behaviour of the bronzes are relatively consistent. NaWO_3\nis the most stable of the cubic systems, although in the hexagonal system the\nlarger ions are more stable. The band structures are identical, with the\nintercalated atom donating its single electron to the tungsten 5d valence band.\nNext, this was extended to a study of fractional doping in the Na_xWO_3 system\n(0 < x < 1). A linear variation in cell parameter, and a systematic change in\nthe position of the Fermi level up into the valence band was observed with\nincreasing x. In the underdoped WO_3-x system however, the Fermi level\nundergoes a sudden jump into the conduction band at around x = 0.2. Lastly,\nthree compounds of a layered WO_4&#215;a,wdiaminoalkane hybrid series were\nstudied and found to be insulating, with features in the band structure similar\nto those of the parent WO_3 compound which relate well to experimental\nUV-visible spectroscopy results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2005 00:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Instrumental realism in the\nEPR context helps us prove that in some special circumstances, one can get\nsimultaneous knowledge of two conjugate quantities, which in particular make\nsense together. This shatters the axiomatic presentation of Quantum Mechanics.\nThis simultaneous knowledge of two conjugate quantities elaborates on 1935 work\nby Schr{\\\"o}dinger, hence the name, \\emph{Schr{\\\"o}dinger Unorthodoxy Theorem},\ngiven to the second main result that is easily deduced from the result on\ninstrumental realism. Once the axiomatic edifice of Quantum Mechanics is\nbroken, we can let go the completeness of the wave function as suggested in\nEPR, and hold fast on locality. The EPR paper of mid-1935 gets here contrasted,\nfrom a new point of view, with a 1936 text where Einstein avoids using\ncounterfactuals. Counterfactuals get a precise definition and the corresponding\nconcept is used all along, but may be new under an old name. We provide a short\ncritical review of Bell's 1964 paper. Then, a small modification of arguments\nfor the Schr{\\\"o}dinger Unorthodoxy Theorem will let appear a simple\nconservation law, combined with the Malus Law, as the origin of the correlation\nin Bell's version of EPRB: this is our third main result. As the fourth main\nresult, a last use of the concept of counterfactual yields the decay of\ngeometry at small enough scale.
