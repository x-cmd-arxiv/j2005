During pre-eruption the object seemed to be\nrelaxing after an initial event which had presumably taken place in last days\nof December 2001. The eruption phase, which lasted till mid-April 2002,\nresulted from a very strong energy burst, which presumably took place in last\ndays of January at the base of the stellar envelope inflated in pre-eruption.\nThe burst produced an energy wave, which was observed as a strong luminosity\nflash in the beginning of February, followed by a strong mass outflow in form\nof two shells, which was observed as an expanding photosphere in later epochs.\nIn mid-April, when the outflow became optically transparent and most of its\nenergy radiated away, the object entered the decline phase during which V838\nMon was evolving along the Hayashi track.

The apparent attenuation law is a composite of the attenuation\nlaws for the clumpy younger stars and for the diffuse older stars with a\nluminosity weight. In general, the stellar population dominating the luminosity\nchanges from older stars to younger stars as the wavelength decreases. This\nmakes the attenuation law steep; the composite attenuation rapidly increases\nfrom small attenuation for older stars at a long wavelength to large\nattenuation for younger stars at a short wavelength. The resultant attenuation\nlaw of normal disc galaxies is expected to be much steeper than that of\nstarburst galaxies observed by Calzetti et al.
